Avoid Things Lyrics
*Inaudible*

In the morning when you're not with me
I feel you in the depths of mind, I found it in deep
Coming through is all I ever want to do
I fall in the steps of human beings
And it's all on you
Now it's onto you, now it's onto you
Now it's onto you, now it's onto you
Now it's onto you, now it's onto you
Now it’s on
I try to avoid things
Avoid things
But there's no one, this is madness
Avoid things
I try to resolve things
Involve you
But you don't want to be sorry

Page me on the beeper, babe
I need a request, babe
I need reason to wait while you relaxing
Take me away today, I'm on a wave today
I whine my waist, and I craze, while my mind's awake
And it's a migraine to play your mind games
You're like a cold place, don't need a cold place
And if you ain't mine then we just waste time
Until new day

I try to avoid things
Avoid things
But there's no one, this is madness
Avoid things
I try to resolve things
Involve you
But you don't want to be sorry (Sorry, oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah)

Badman wanna craze, save me from this
Save me from, save me from

I try to avoid things
Avoid things
But there's no one, this is madness
Avoid things
I try to resolve things
Involve you
But you don't want to be sorry

Decided Lyrics
Blessedly peace in the deep of sleep
Time is in sync for the company
Lights will go out if you come for me
Fire and ice on the streets

I dive in the deep end
I've been sinking
To begin with
In the absence of your conscience
Death is silent
I decided
I need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper (Mhmm)
Need to go deeper

Never known my dad, never understood
He's been in my life but never in the loop
Heavy on my heart since I was a youth
If I lost him now, don't know what I'd do
But I need to go deeper fighting for freedom
My mind is a legion
Remember days when they said I wouldn't live up
Many times I didn't see trust
Many times I didn't see love
Now they see fire in my eyes
And wonder why everything took so long (Yeah)

I dive in the deep end
I've been sinking
To begin with
In the absence of your conscience
Death is silent
I decided

Falling LyricsHigh on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can’t we do like that
If I was Moses I'll part seas and move mountains Your heart bleeds for a new accountant, coz it was stolen
I should've taken more care when I stepped up to be the one that you had chosen
I wish we could go back, but time doesn’t care about missed opportunities, or lies we both use
Or the price of the queen that I lost in two moves
I wanna kiss the scar even though I left the bruise on your heart
My name is on your Lips
And I see you everywhere I go!
And baby if I slip
Would you save me when I'm falling
Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I’m falling
High for my baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
I made mistakes, I can’t forget it
I felt your love, it's incandescence
Nothing’s changed except addresses
One song can't hold all my confessions

We should have stayed exclusive like country club though
I held on to excuses, it's time to let go
Coz immature games are for old Nintendo’s

I had to realize sometimes falling is the biggest step that we ever take
All I need is a leap of faith

Save me when I'm falling
Even when I'm all in
They don't make love like this no more
Answer when I'm calling
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Save me when I'm falling
High on me baby cos you light up on it
Eyes on me baby when you whine upon it
Die for you baby put my life upon it
Ride for me baby you know I must admit
When you do like that
You make me wan move right back
Why can't we move time back
Why can't we do like that
Come around my way
Don't leave just stay
I don't wanna make the same mistakes, yeah
Come around my way

TranslationsEspañolFound Lyrics
People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this

Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh

Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance  (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earnings
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in

The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me

All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane
My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take mе out
Tell you what I need right here

I rеally need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mind now, uh, yeah

This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
And the other one price that you cannot fix
This is the peace that you cannot buy

And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again

With your deaf ears
Open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
What do you want from a life of the hopeless
Now here you are, you're begging and crying

Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah

Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you

Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence
Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you

Ooh, ooh, oohEmbed

But somethin' better's waitin' at your door

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

It's been three years, still countin'
You in love, but still doubtin'
If he's in love with you (He's in love with you)
(Find someone who loves you)
Omoge, I know you got that vibe
Shey him dey do you well ?
Shey him dey make you smile ?
Shey him dey treat you right ?
Are you happy? (Are you happy?)
(You don't know your worth)

When you lose hope, soon you will be found

Live Life Lyrics
Classic (Classic)

Said Afrikaner, when I'm on the vibe
And I'm undercover, when I'm on the way
So I need a day, when I run away
As in, I wanna leave, said I wanna dip
So I need a jet, and I went away
Not the internet, 'cause we only met
But I wanna wall
I just wanna ball, yeah
So imagine the energy
It remains in my memory
Ears will hear and the eyes will see
I won't give no apologies, no, no
Can you feel me?
I am living, I am living my life now
I am living, I am living my time now
I am living, I am living my life

So live life (Live life)
No time (No time)
So livе life (Live life)
No timе (No time)

It's January night celebrating life
Elevator high, semenating life
A white tiger can't deny or take away my stripes
Through the valleys in the peaks, we maintain the hype
Great advice, heard it from a nigga like
Making nice moves, shoot the dice, but your aim is nice
No time, no time, gotta say it twice
Life's full of living, I'm just tripping of the greatest vice
Strong roots bare fruit, you got the juice within
Back against the wind, time to win again
Grab my fire dripping pants, tie it to my xan
Tell the universe to bend, then produce a gem
You know the blend make it classy
I ain't even capping
Three tapes in a row, that's a hat trick
Tell so and so you can adapt it
If you want that original vibe, you gon' blast this
You might also like
So imagine the energy
It remains in my memory
Ears will hear and the eyes will see
I won't give no apologies, no no
Can you feel me?
I am living, I am living my life now

I am living, I am living my life

So live life (Live life)
No time (No time)
So live life (Live life)
No time (No time)

Live life my guy, no think twice
My head anointed with oil, my drip nice
We manifesting the vibes on this side
They tried to trick guys their lies ain't sit right
In the eye of the storm we sit tight, even when there was turbulence in flight
Swear the world didn't prepare for these times
The weak will switch sides, the eagles keep flying
'Cause, that's why we came, not for the fame
Make sure  that's the word that remains
Ogunmade, that's the blood of a king
When you hear the bang just know you're now rocking with the livest
Tell me what your vibe is
Cruise for the night?
Music that is timeless
If it is for the latter make I holla you in private
If you can describe it, then show dem will provide it

Ordinary People Lyrics
Take it slow
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

Boy, I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Passed the infatuation phase
Tight in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
Seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
We both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybе we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this timе we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusions
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up and you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Baby, you and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people, mmm
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

Peace Lyrics
This feels like drugs
That I don't want
'Cause every touch
Makes me want more

Can't go a single day without using
Can't go a single day without looking
Now my eyes so glued and I'm losing sight of everything around me
Can't go a single day without using
Can't go a single day without looking
Going through withdrawals
Peace sign, peace sign to you
I wanna give you the peace sign, peace sign forever
Peace sign, peace sign to you
I wanna give you the peace sign forever
Peace sign

What an unfortunate situation
I'm tirеd of doing things for confirmation
I need to save my time and enеrgy
I don't need to be yours
You don't need to be mine

What do you want from me?
You're too bad for a medicine
I can't hide when you calling me
I can't think when you chaining me (Yeah, yeah)
What do you want from me?
I'm so tired of falling in
I need peace from the enemy
Give me time for my sanity

Can't go a single day without using
Can't go a single day without looking
Now my eyes so glued and I'm losing sight of everything around me
Can't go a single day without using

Yeah-yeah, yeah, no, woah, oh, oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah, mm
Mm, mm-hmm, mm

Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but e never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard me about me
It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay
Who this guy that they say they wan try me?
Who this guy and they say they wan play me?
Who this guy that they say they wan break?
Who this guy that they say they wan shake?
All this time that they wan break, yeah
All this time that them think they wan take, yeah
Who this guy that he say wan pie me?
Who this guy that he say he wan define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, boy, nah me they call (Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh, ah)

Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on days, when they tried to arrest me
But if you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things  but I'll break it
You name it boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what is for me

Shadow Of Doubt Lyrics
What it feels like to have your entire
Belief system overload with skepticism
To never know the day that you'll finally be able
To live beyond the shadow of doubt
After living in its darkness for so long
Seems like I have all the right questions
But never enough answers
And my faith is small enough
To fill in the cracks of our palms... God
Every night I lay my head down to sleep
The city of my mind is attacked
By a legion of questions
Threatening the living rooms of my sanity
In order to be.... help me help me help me
Bright lights guy, put it on
Stardom's close, I feel the storms
But how I can I elevate myself
When my immediate environment
Is looking quite deformed
My egbon told me Wale there’s a guy code
Blam babes, make dough and just lie low
If not, Lagos will turn you to a psycho
While I feel, he just told me live fast to die slow
And I smoke, then I float
Then I walk on tightropes
It’s naija, sometimes hopeless
Sometimes we might grow
Fat lady’s singing but won’t hit them high notes
I’m like "bro, It’s like we just stuck in a cycle"
My guy dey vex he had triplets
Hasn’t even finished setting up his business
Meanwhile, they giving yansh out for Christmas
Men these babes are not playing men
Check the statistics
It’s cold out here in these streets

You can't shoot me when you know that I'm out
You can't move me if you know that I'm not there now
You're hiding in a cloud bed of lies
And you're stuck behind; a shadow of doubt
You might also like
What's our purpose on this earth?
Are we free or are we slaves?
Destiny and destination
Are they different or the same?
If God knows every move
Before I even choose a lane
Do I have free will?
Does my future alternate?
How come humans only be using
10% of their brains?
How can I be 'out' my mind
And still be 'in'-sane?
Why don't all African countries unite? Make peace?
Why we call that shit freedom
Knowing that it's not free?
Who's sending subliminal messages on my TV?
Are these economic systems just a form of slavery?
With all of this information...
How does one pick out the truth?
Why's the whole world obsessed
With power and making loot?
Okay we export oil...
How bout our refineries?
Are we married to corruption
Or is it like a disease?
If the answer is the latter
Then does someone know the cure?
Should we use the word holy
In conjunction with a war?
Whats Good? Whats Bad?
Whats Evil? Whats pure?
How do I free my mind?
My emotions? and my thoughts?
How come sometimes I get the feeling
That I've been here before?
These are just a few questions
That be troubling ya boy... you know
The election is over
Declare me winner
It's time to rule
Ibrahim is the president
He won all the local governments
And they are taking us to court

You can't shoot me when you know that I'm out
You can't move me if you know that I'm not there now
You're hiding in a cloud bed of lies
And you're stuck behind; a shadow of doubtEmbed

They told me hillsparks, if you wanna hit
Do you know how long we be running shit?

Before they would request for me, I had to paystacks
Before they tried to steal my shit I had to take it back
Now I’m back!

Tales By Moonlight Lyrics
It's all tales by moonlight
Tales by moonlight
Mehn, it's tales by moonlight
Classic

How many times they ask us for fine
They say make we grow, they fucked with my mind
They hide in their clothes, it's all a design
They no give us light, they say make we shine
It's tales by moonlight
Mehn, it's tales by moonlight, yeh
It's tales by moonlight, ah
Guys it's tales by moonlight
She startin' to whine, I feel her behind
Omo e set, she fuck with my mind
She talk say na love, I talk say na lie
Then after I bounced, she talk say na crime

It's all tales by moonlight
It's all tales by moonlight
Tales by moonlight
Then it's tales by moonlight
Come on

Story, story is what you give me all days
I'm on a search for somethin' real
Currency, you say na currrency oh
But honestly
Truth no get pikin', try to get me
Try to get me please
I need some honesty
I need some honesty
Honesty

Ah, Tec had the Mary J, so we rolled one up
That's like numerology code for the 411
Put me back into ghost mode to where flows comes from
An entirely different axis of the globe young blud
Then tell the engineer to make sure my vocals are plush
In Kingsman mode, 
Around the edges, 'cause it evolves accordin' to us
Is put your smarts on and get stripped of all that you love
But this pole is for hire, can head into war in a tux
When it's biz, come correct when you're talkin' to us
If it ain't ownership or equity then, they ain't offered enough
And if the price is my peace then it cost too much
Preach

Témiladè Interlude Lyrics:
So I thought, hmm okay
So everybody was like, "Oh, another boy is coming"
So I kept on telling them, "This is a girl"
"So why on earth can you be so sure? Ahan what's that rubbish?"
Yes she said, "This is a girl, her name is Témìládè"
"Don't forget the name I told you and she's a special baby"
So I kept on telling everybody
They kept on laughing, "Yeah yeah yeah"
All those, "Yo maybe you had a dream about it Abi?"
Eh, it most unlikely
Nobody can tell anybody's, you know
Eh, whether it's a baby girl or boy
I just kept telling them that God told me
This is a girl and hеr name is Témìládè
"You can't just pick a name for yourself, familiеs give names"
Well, I don't know, but I know that her name is Témìládè, shaYou might also likeEmbed

They all want a key to the garden

No man can curse what God has madе

When they tried to take me down
We'll be flying off the ground
When the world is going out
When the earth is falling in

This is the mind, this is the light
This is the time, this is the way
I see the dream coming before me
I've been the one, don't have to say it
This is the vibe, don't need to fake it
Seeing the world, living beyond it
This is the key, so I can save you

Well I don't like to turn my back

Too Bad Lyrics
What's the matter oh?
Omo you make my head dey scatter oh
Find some time and let's connect
I won't say much 'cause more is less
Hey, too fine for your own good or you too bad
Too bad, too bad bad bad too bad, too bad
Too fine for your own good or you too bad
Too bad bad bad too bad, too bad, too bad
I believe you were meant for me
You're not my judge you're my destiny
Come let's escape I know just the place
You in my life is a testimony
Old thing back
She said she want that old thing back
She said she want that old thing back
My mind drifts so many places when I start to recollect how we met
Smoked a lot so sometimes I do forget
I just know that something shifted in the planet where we step
The very spot where the Niger and the Delta intersect, we connect
Then we flow, pluck a dream from the sky watch it grow
Was she sent to help me navigate the road
While I'm still searching for balance on my own?
I don't know, but I'm blessed
Feel our love manifest
Chasing dreams but with you I find rest
Middle finger anybody who wan test
Yes, I give my guys the best advice
Never try to change someone or you'll be stressed for life
Never try to clip her wings, she was meant to fly
Heard her voice in my head and it sounded like this

Too fine for your own good or you too bad
Too bad, too bad bad bad too bad, too bad, too bad
Too fine for your own good or you too bad
Too bad bad bad too bad, too bad, too bad

Got this bad piece puzzling my mind like a jigsaw
Hit me from the blind side, now I'm on the line like
'Where you at? I know you saw my missed calls'
Hate being sidelined
Hate the fact I even give a damn like I shouldn't be this pissed off
Why tho'? 'Cause she's just my type, can't even stay mad at the chick
With these symptoms to withdraw
Forget the bag before we discuss
I came here to get my things girl it's time for lift-off
Yeah, now we above the cloud
Losing breath as we drown in these lovers sounds yeah
Shut it down, we go shut it down
Ever felt the summer vibe in the wintertime
We straight killing it but got the skies feeling alive
I was told you can't disguise it it's in your eyes
Real shit you epitomise
Girl you too bad

I know it must be hard, just trying to be mine
You call me, come alive and say it loud
If I give you one more day
Run fast and don't be late, I need you to say my name
All night all morning, so you wan try, wanna practice
Can you give love to a dragon, give me one day 'cause I'm leaving
Shouldn't need you to remind you
Say you wan fly, you want a break tho'
I need a test, need a sample
Give me one night to invite you
Too fine for your own good or you too bad
Too bad, too bad bad bad too bad, too bad, too bad
Too fine for your own good or you too bad

Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I will wait for you)

Wait For You (Freestyle) LyricsVerse One:
613
Prepare for what it mean
This disco dream
It ain’t a party follow me
Walking through the fire
You want the edge
More desires
Perverts don’t retire
Heard she blushing while they dying
Bleed more sweat
More blessings when they come through
Can’t fear death it’s the puzzle don’t you leave clues
You heard it could rain
Our story don’t read the same
These few words we exchanged
There’s only one that could save
So look up
World was ending Would you cry
Look up, there's only one that could save so look up
Or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I need you to be clear
I ain't your savior, I ain't a playa
(I will wait for you, for you)
(I will wait for you, for you)
I ain't a player, I ain't your savior
(I will wait for you, for you)
(I will wait for you, for you)
I ain't a player, I ain't your savior
Ending Verse:
The double twisted end
Had dinner with twisted friends
Gave you hope gave you love
But baby let’s play pretend
That the pressure wasn’t dripping more than innocent blood
The words came to club
I think it’s time to go home but no rushYou might also likeEmbed
