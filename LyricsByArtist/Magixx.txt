Archimedes Principle Lyrics
Value this time in your life kids
Because this is the time in your life when you still have your choices
And it goes by so fast
When you are teenager, you think you can do anything and you do
Your 20s are a blur
30s, you raise your family, you make a little money and then you think to yourself
"What happened to my 20s?"
40s, you grow a little pot belly, you grow another chin
The music starts to get too loud
One of your old girlfriend from high school becomes a grandmother
50s you have a minor surgery, you'll call it a procedure, but it's a surgery
60s you'll have a major surgery, the music is still loud, but it doesn't matter anyway cos you can't hear it
70s, you and your wife retire to Fort Lauder dale
Start eating dinner at 2'o'clock in the afternoon, have lunch around 10, breakfast the night before
Spend  most your time wandering around malls looking for the ultimate soft yogurt and muttering "how come the kids don't call? How come the kids don't call?"
80s you'll have a major stroke
You'll end up babbling to some Jamaican nurse who your wife can't stand but then you call mama
Any questions?
Why do I feel like this life is short
I try to make a difference in my time but end up lost
Trynna be self aware
Be ahead of my peers
Self inflicted with pressure
Fuck it I need me some air
Faced with the sames decisions I felt that my daddy made
Will my choices be same?
Am I gotta be the change?
I guess we call a spade a spade if I make his mistakes
If I’m walking his steps, if I never take a break
If I try to make it big and end up losing my way
What’s the story Imma tell?
How will my siblings fare?
What about all my friends
Are we all gonna be great?
Are we all gonna be great?
Every birthday seeming like a countdown
I thought I’d be a billionaire like about now
Thought I would be done with school by 21
I don’t even remember clocking 21
I understand addiction
I understand fear
I understand isolating yourself in despair
I understand dressing up just so you can go to bed
You got all these clothes but got no time to wear
Or got no place to be or got no friends to share
Remember you had a guy
Remember you had a girl
Remember when said she was pregnant and got you scared
Remember when your biggest problem was how to take a test
The emotions that you felt, that shit was really real
Spent all of my time working and forgot I was s'posed to feel
Spent all my time working, I forgot I’m s'posed to feel
You might also like
It feels like yesterday, things were so amazing
Another time and place, she in different phases
I made too much mistakes, wish I could erase it
How did I, how did I, how did I get here?
How did I, how did I, how did I get here?
How did I, how did I, how did I get here?
How did I, how did I, how did I get here?
How did I, how did I get here?Embed

Uncertainties Lyrics
Yeah
Oh lord ma God, Yeah
Mitch Angelo

I live my life on the edge
Nothing to stop me but death
Ambitions going in circles I pray I don’t disconnect
Cause I been looking for answers fingers been scratching for depth
Are you feeling stress? Are you inside my head?
Apologies cos i been feeling like this since I was a boy
I’ve always gotten house, I’ve always wanted a home
I’ve always cried when I felt empty like I've been filled before
Ever gotten A and still wanted something more
Being insatiable has fucked me up when getting results
Maybe I did get the win why don’t I feel like I won
Why don’t I feel can win again if this shit was redone
Maybe I really was lucky, but when did luck give a fuck
Every sacrifice I made has brought me right to this spot
But then my Niggas are happy, and don’t got what I got
And they don’t got my experiences and they don’t got my results
Am I doing it right, am I doing it wrong
Is all this shit really worth it or maybe it is fate that working
I'm really confused by the shit that you do
I'm really confused by the shit that you do

Throw back to the days when I thought I want this
Now I'm up here and I think I'm selfish
Cos mama tell me say boy you'll be okay
I pray that my niggas are great
As long as my niggas are great
But I'm never satisfied
Never Never
Never Never

Am I underrated? Am I overrated?
Everyone debated
Even when they looked on with hatred, I was motivated
Even when they looked on with praise, I just know they hated
Everything I do for buzz
Do I do enough? do I do too much?
Should I pull the plug?
Should I kill my dreams? Should I do for love?
Would they love me more if they knew what's up
Put my trust in the game and it drew my blood
Am I over heads? Am I good enough?
Women called me boo and then booed me off...
.. when they waited and waited for greatness delayed and money trees for shade but it took too long
And they hated the lateness, migrated to niggas getting paid and said I'll never bloom at all
And it's sad to think of
I should bring up...
...the times that I met y'all fakes and you said that we had to link up
I had to drink up
...the lies with hope as a mixer
Got broken and fixed up
Nobody holding me down, they provoking my lift off
But... Am I worthy of rise
A bird in the skies?
One of the coolest or a nerd in disguise
This burden of mine..
..I carry is hurting my spine
I worry sometimes
Torn between remaining me...
... Or becoming the fake niggas you came to see
Smoke rappers on a track when I mirror my idols..
.. Or hide behind smoke and mirrors
Water down and soak the lyrics
What the fuck should I do
My folks are proud. Are they really though?
Or is the morale really low..
.. Cos the first son never brought a milli home
On my left is a booth, on my right is a 9 to 5 desk
Devil and the deep blue sea. How do I survive death?
Why should I stress?
Maybe I should just say fuck it and be done with this shit
Or maybe my next move about to put me on some rich shit...
...like that's what I care about

But I'm never satisfied

Wake up in the morning, hallelujah
Chasin' the money
Chasin' the bag
No lookin' back
Me and my gang
Steady fire we leave no gap
Gucci, Gucci, Louis V
Mix my Monster with Hennessy
My eye don dirty, I no fit see
The smell of doings shall lead me
Baby girl, why you cryin'?
Clean your tears with my currency
Bullion van outside the club
Who tell you say we need protection?
Hop in my all black challenger
All road leadin' to the dynasty
We know ourself and they know we
Hm, they know we

Won Le Le Lyrics
You know I don't even blame you
You didn't notice us
We started to shine
Yeah

They didn't notice 'til the moment I started to glow
Now pretty ladies drop it lower than konko below
Is that the reason that I carry my shoulders so high?
I guess it's just the arrogance starting to show (Trust me)
Now it's all about the commas when I'm speaking grammar (Woah)
Balenciaga bag under the Agbada (Yeah)
Remember when we couldn't even break bread? (Break bread)
Now I'm sitting at the table observing my manners
Chop bag, clean mouth, everybody code
Pull-up backstage, every groupie no be hoe
Funny when you blow you be everybody bro (I swear)
At least I got lifelines to show
Make no man come pour sand, sand for my garri
Me I dey grind nonstop
Me no wan hear if it's not 'bout the money, ah
As I dey run my run
Make no man come pour sand, sand for my garri, ah

If I never fall for you (Oh Lord)
Where you dey?

I no fit fall, if I never fall for you
This is the love that I prayed from the beginning
Oh, girl, you make the man to believe
Baby, bring in the heat, mo n gbona

Nobody can fall like I did when you and I met
I was never in your class as if I skipped a semester
If I ever learnt a thing, it wasn't regrets
I was way too deep into your business like I'm your investor
I'm a rapper so I can't explain
How I really don't know what to say
The same person wey dey give me life
Same one takes my breath away
Takes a little more than liquor bottles
And a bunch of video models
Twerking on the floor just to get me lit
Only time I should be seeing double is my bank account
And all the times you call me up to help me scratch that itch

Baby girl, I stand for your back
Omo me and you make we sankeleba
Baby, say na you I go choose forever
Baby, say na you I go
I no fit chop if I never fall for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I no fit fall if I never fall for you
Say I no fit love if I never love you
