You carry army go kill many youth for Lekki
Na so water woo watеr

Nothing you go talk wey go justify thе case of their murder

The chief of staff, the commander and the army wey carry order
Mr President, Mr Governor
Godfather, gbo gbo IJOBA
All your atrocities
All of your corner corner
Make all the dead body disturb you for your dream

The money wey you thief yapa for your azza
You don turn our graduates to common beggars
All the book them go no matter
Cuz you no go get job if you no know godfather

The chief of staff, the commander and the army wey carry order
Mr President, Mr Governor
Godfather, gbo gbo IJOBA
All your atrocities
All of your corner corner
Make all the dead body disturb you for your dream

I wanna lay inside you .. I wanna live inside you

Ride you like I'm on a high-way
I'm gonna love you over and over, lay-back

You know you're gonna get it right, tonight
From the couch, to the table, on the floor, to the wall
Take you places never been before
No penniless could ride-away .. yeah
Lemme come into you
Baby, you want me to
I'm ready to do the things you want
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you

I tell Monica bye-bye, she gon' scream my name
She say she can't hang when I'm with my crew
I need you now, wanna take my time
Girl, I'm really tryna find out if you remember me
The nigga you gave your virginity
Cummin', I see .. If you feel the same, when I put it in, eh
I know you' been, eh .. fucking couple more niggas
Tryna to get it ready for a nigga
Don't you see a nigga looking at you looking good?
I've been having thoughts, why you're always getting cautious
You know, I gather the numbers
See her simulating answers, look who the Boss is
Like fuck you know her, how a nigga see me so deep
You wonder; When? If he saw me
You need to come to my side and see how I rock her side

Don Gorgon riding true man hustle without a curfew
Along side de one AKA come fi steal this show
Dis a robbery de whole a dem fi know

Time to get them goons and kick your door down
Niggas ain't running anymore now
Bang bang, everybody kiss the floor now

Robbery, robbery, robbery (All eyes on me) Robbery, robbery, robbery (Robbery)

I'm tryna get this rap money in a rush
Tell 'em back it up for me when you see me in the club
Competition dead and buried in the dust
I'm like the legendary Brenda Fassie, Zola Budd
Once you get it, you never get enough
And you gon' need better credit to get ahead of us
We the power circle, comin' to you live from the third world
Gettin' high off the purple (Ay)
Bitch, I'm on the top of my game
Black car, rap star, look at my face
If you ain't fuckin' what you here for?
I got a 7:30 shuttle to the airport, therefore
Twerk contest, I'm a nuisance
Jah bless, do it for the youth dem
I'm at the table with the bosses
You need to table up your losses

And it's four now
Time to get them goons and kick your door down
Niggas ain't running anymore now
Bang bang, everybody kiss the floor now
It's a (Robbery)
All eyes on me, I see nobody
Stick 'em up and freeze while I steal the show

A couple of bad bitches from the States (From the States)
Skateboards in my bedroom wall
I had to take it back to the North 94
Dollies on my penthouse floor
Now it's all white parties on a stretched out lawn, North (North)
These streets is cold
You on the outside smoking sticks and stones
I'm all about mine like Patrice's gold
And I ain't gon' stop till I reach my goal (Y'all ain't fucking with me)
Leaked nudes on the iPad (Gcwala)
Previews on the Snapchat (Ziyawa)
'Cause I'm popping off (Shower)
Like 'em Naija boys

Alright, roundabout now I wanna bring everybody's club status right back down to the ground level
Big shout out to Pink Cadillacs

And of course we can't forget Kick-ass Kenny Mastry
Cause now we in the mainstream

Another Story Lyrics
To understand Nigeria, you need to appreciate where it came from
In 1900, Britain officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole of what we now know as Nigeria from the Niger Company
And then, gradually over the years, British protectorates were established throughout the territory
In 1914, the protectorates were amalgamated into one Nigeria
Actually, there's one additional detail that bears mentioning. In order to take over the territories from the Niger Company, the British Government paid 865,000 pounds. A huge amount in 1900. So let's establish a simple truth, the British didn't travel halfway across the world just to spread democracy
Nigeria started off as a business deal for them, between a company and a government. Incidentally, the Niger Company is still around today. Only it is known by a different name, Unilever
But that's another story
(It's Kel-P vibes)

Ay!

Every year be the same cock and bull

Everyday for thief man, one day for master

Heavy with the youth, war already with the proof

Money talks, it's a public service announcement
Everyone know who the baddest in the South is
So I put my gold status where my mouth is
Do you know what it feel like to get to the pinnacle?
Beverly Hills life, let's dip in the swimming pool
We getting physical, lets fuck in the living room
I'm in my element but you got the mineral
It's critical
Every rap king need a theme song
Every trap queen need a king kong
Put you on the team, put the ring on

Gotta get this money tree in the bank for us to grow
Big picture thinker, ducking the paparazzi
Staying out of Shwashi scriptures
She's a praying mosadi ga satane a nteka
Momma told me it’d be cheaper to keep her
I made momma lefika
That's my bundle of boitumelo
Walking taller than super model, stiletto
My heart singing in that Dana's falsetto
High as the polo lights in the ghetto
How she get when I'm in the middle
How she swallow what's on the menu?
Barking maar ha a na meno
Ncwanya ngwanyana eno
Stocking, stocking, stalking an instrumental
Bumping, tswakin', fucking it up a little

Bank on It Lyrics
Yeah
Life is sweet when the sun up
Like the trees in the summer
When the seas are troubled
Then we all need someone
My life Omo
No be small thing Omo
We all strive for more
To live life ina comfort
So forgive me if I fumble
'Cause I am only human
Somebody move that I don’t know
Hit them with the seven box combo
Always looking out my window
Paranoid  and confused
I'm not sure anymore
Who is knocking at my door?
And so as the day comes, as I go on
Protect me Lord, I cannot trust my neighbors
Be my saviour
When that day comes
Defend me from my enemies and my neighbors

Twist my fingers up and bang on 'em

Different type of evil available
And any one of them can killi you
At anytime anything can happen, oh
Any one of us could have been Pop Smoke
We must go when the most high call us

Wear my vest and clean my gun up

Calm Down Lyrics
Explore my open sea
Let my emotions see
If i should stumble off my feet
I hope that no one sees
I know, no one can save us (no)
So i just put all my pain and my problems in this styrofoam cup
And drink it all away
So here we go
Feeling so good (so good)
(listen) Got me moving in slow motion
(listen) I'm trying to walk on top of the ocean
I numb the pain
Numb the pain
Numb the pain
As the sun shine on me (on me)
Oh Lord have his mercy
JAE5

My baby say she wonder why i'm not around more
And is she getting what she came for
Wonder why i'm laughing all out for
I'm high baby
That's the sound when i'm inside you
And now i got you singing high notes
My doctor got something for you
To get on my level
And make you calm down

Calm down
You have fi calm down
My baby calm down
Calm down
Cause if i start now, i no go calm down
Mi nah calm down

Solid like my granny
Solid like my daddy
Life no easy for me
So don't worry about what i'm drinking
I'm popping molly's in public
Bet they wish they'd never given me money
Cause i won't believe anything you tell me
I don't listen to nobody, don't tell me

Mm, dem dey pray, make I fall and stagger
So I move in, cloak and dagger

In a Lambo' with Jowi Zaza
Diamond teeth with a pocket full of rabba
No shirt, nigga, looking like I'm a robber
Since I start, dem dey carry my matter
No be now ,we go scatter my dada (Huhn)

Oti pe n'be
Shey 'be le ma sun

Yeah, yo
Thеm dey pray we go fall and stagger
Arе you mad? You know why dem man call me Baba?
To catch eye, you gon need one bigger and a taller ladder (Big one)
Just there dancing, dagger
I'm outside chilling, ragga
What's all the higgy hagger?
When I come with the Ninki Nanka (Big one)
Now my jacket was shining like Bianca
Now dem man there wish they never done that (What?)
Now everybody Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder
Niggas doing 8 mile when they hear the thunder
Make a nigga wake up, rise from your slumber
I ain't even green yet, man, I'm still on amber
Why you wanna see me fall down, see me under?
Sometimes I gotta think hard, and I ponder
They can come close, come here but they want to
Just stay far, stay there, smoke your ganja (Okay, okay, okay)
Twenty-four hours ain't enough for gangster (Nah)
No sleep, now my eyes looking like a panda
Do dem man dere really wanna pass a passer? (What?)
When we pull up, they gon' have to go and call for Jah Jah
Go and call for Yah Allah
See, me ah marga
When your time has come, nigga, don't make it harder
Can't catch him today, we gon' see tomorrow
Only witness was Tia Tamera

Come and walk the yellow brick road
Feel the rush of platinum and gold

They tell me it’s the land of the free
Opportunity for people like me

Live the dream, feel the fever, I wish you well

You better listen when I roar, because them start dangerous
Coming from a place that's just wild and corrupt
I’ma see God soon, I’ll return to you

Dem No Know LyricsAnd they say I'm bad, me have no friend
Just 'cause I'm real I can't pretend
Holding back no evidence
One day I'll be your president
Don't be surprised when you see me on tour
Acting  like I don't know you no more
No be now but when I blow up
Dem no fit talk say dem no know before
See I've been feeling like I'm stuck in a pipeline
And I've been feeling like this all my lifetime, ohhh
Patiently wait for the right time
Then I'll come out and tell you what's on my mind, ohhh
A couple niggas that had it too bad
They wishin they could run away and never go back
Never seen a perfect picture like a Kodak
And that's a known fact
Wishin I could have my way
But everything has been going sideways
Everyone's picking a reason to fight me
Nobody likes me, but I count my blessings
And I tell you like this
They say I'm bad, me have no friend
Just 'cause I'm real I can't pretend
Holding back no evidence
One day I'll be your president
Don't be surprised when you see me on tour
Acting  like I don't know you no more
No be now but when I blow up
Dem no fit talk say dem no know before
They hope to God me wanna sleep 'cause they wishin I don't wake up
'Cause I'm always real, no makeup
Some boy think they smarter than Jacob
Said if I sell my birthright, I'll get famous
You can't take man fi Esau
What you're looking at is a very smart nigga
Don't feel the consciousness that I deliver
I know a couple man that'll cut out your liver
Mmm, you people get me so confused
That's why around me only a chosen few are welcome
So when I tell them 'thank you' I know I'm welcome
They don't know so I tell them
They say I'm bad, me have no friend
Just 'cause I'm real I can't pretend
Holding back no evidence
One day I'll be your president
Don't be surprised when you see me on tour
Acting  like I don't know you no more
No be now but when I blow up
Dem no fit talk say dem no know before

The toe you stepped on last year might wanna settle the score

So I won't owe you no apologies
This is the last time that you'll see a bad guy like me-e-e-e-e
They say I'm bad, me have no friend

Destiny Lyrics
Feel good
I ain't gonna lie to you
I don't know about you
In a prison or a hospital
Yeah, when I buy shit
My ting dem costly
I remember when I used to hustle in the flats
And the neighbours then had no love for me
Switch it up, now everything blessed
Hit the stage with the gyallies, say yeah yeah, yeah yeah
When them rise up against me
Me looking at them eyes and sing
Destiny, can't touch my destiny
Them are try everything
Them are try take me life
But I won't let them get the best of me
Destiny, can't touch my destiny
They can take everything I have
They can take my life
They can't touch my destiny

You don't know, man a Ghaza thug
Man are slice up your head like a barber does
No, you no really really wan' start with us
'Cause we dangerous and hazardous
Skrr, beep beep when I'm parking up
California weed, man are sparking up
And I see my enemies, them charging up
'Cause we never smile when them try laugh with us
As a little youth it was hard enough
'Cause dem older guys, them were starving us
So me hustle till me start live marvellous
Roll deep like I'm driving a party bus
We was just a bunch of fuckin' foreigners
No one to trust, I know that they don't want me here
Came a long way from standing in the corridors
Dunking feds in the coroners
Hey

Devil In California Lyrics
Have to understand what i'm trying to show ya
Take you OT where nobody knows ya
I don’t know what you’ve been told baby
Lately I've been on my own baby
I don’t even know where i'm taking ya
Probably on a boat in the middle of the ocean
Way too drunk, I'm way too fucked baby
Popped a molly in the club babe

Ooh I met the devil out in California
I've been living on the edge
But I won't fall down
Got a couple hunnids for the spending
You should learn to share baby (Oh no)
I'm crazy, I know
How I did it, I don’t know
Heart breaker, all yours
I know I, said i'd change my life
But that was last night
I'm so high
Can't open my eyes
Can't look in your eyes

You got the juice
I got the sauce
It's only right we hit it off
But you gotta make a decision
You got the hoes
I got my woes
I cannot lose
But tonight i'm too fucked up to make decisions
I got soo much bitches
It's like all my life i've been knowing somethings been missing
Devil on my shoulder
That's why i can't stay sober

Ooh I met the devil out in California
I've been living on the edge
But I won't fall down
Got a couple hunnids for the spending
You might also like
You should learn to share baby (Oh no)
I'm crazy, I know
How I did it, I don’t know
Heart breaker, all yours
I know I, said i'd change my life
But that was last night
I'm so high
Can't open my eyes
Can't look in your eyes

Give it one more time
But i said that last time
I know i said that last time
But this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time (Oh ya)Embed
 
 
Different Lyrics
Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one called Big Gong-Zilla alongside Burna Boy, ya know
Yes rude boy!

Ya dun know we different
Different style we delivering
I don't have no equivalent
Different predicament
Every day a different problem
Different lie from the government
Different politics, people with different qualities
Different tings dem happening
Different feeling, looking for a different healing
Read it with a different meaning
Different book
Come with a different look
Same spliff, different toke
Different election, sell a different false hope
Then them hang us with a different rope
It's a different time, different tings pon me mind
Different steps we ah climb
While dem connive
Different egos collide
Back full of different knives
Different we look
Although we're different, still we're similar
Every man bleed blood, that's a big similarity
Seven billion show one cinema
One world we live in
And through social media become the new encyclopedia
Exposing reality in a real time
Click a button and watch a video
Then you just might find
Every man love dem family
That is another familiarity
To demonstrate the similarity
That doesn't mean there's not a big difference up in equality
Ya copy from the real original
Ya dun know we different

Different acts of belligerence
But differently intelligent
Different medicine, me nah talk chemical medicine
Different leaves and remedies
Different studying of my roots and origin
Tell my truth in melodies
History teachers attest to the different lies though
Different from what me find out
You know say knowledge is the key and ah dat dem a hide out
You might also likeFuck up the youth dem mind
Bringing a different force
So different gun we ah buss
You know it ain't hard to find us

So don't try to act like my friend
Like you knew me from back... when?
Na na na na na
Try not to bother 'bout ma character
Instead of asking questions like a barrister
You should have gone straight to my manager
You go listen carefully
My brother

But if anybody diss my mother
Me don't heard 'bout the boy
Mе no fear batty boy
But if dem dey nеaring up, me can murder the boy, cah
When dem coming through
Dem skin ah boy like cigarette
Anyone with disrespect

I mean, I spoke clear word
And me spoke clearly
Can no battybouy ever come near me
Why dem stepping back, if dem know firmly?
One false move and it's over, G
Me ah pledge, Nigeria me country
Me am from the city
Where the niggas always hungry
Riding with dem niggas
That will run up on your mumzy
De-de-de-de-de-dem diss me dem dead
Gunshot de whola dem fi getta
Skin ah burn just like cigarette
If you diss my mother
You'll be fucking with the wrong person
Coulda be caucasian, black or persian

Get scar, son

Diss ma mum

So rude, boy
Don't bother trying
Violate, I'm brusing again

Freedom Freestyle Lyrics
Yo turn my headphones up a likkle bit
You can lock the locks, but you can't stop the clocks
Freedom is a must, get me
Got some problems, problems, problems
Can somebody show me a way that I can solve them
They calling police and they saying that I robbed him
They calling for back up, bringing the whole squad in
Now they screaming get on the floor, they got me crawling
Now they slapping cuffs on my wrists, I'm getting brought in
I can explain officer, but they would not let me
Anything I say, will be used against me
So its best that I surrender gently
And they would provide a lawyer to defend me
I ain't got to say bad 'bout the law I demanded, I still got remanded
Da-da-da-da-deh-da-da-deh-da-da-do
Now I get feds everywhere that I go
And I wanna take a piss and security follows
When I go to court, holding my bible 
I got some problems, problems, problems
Can somebody show me a way that I can solve them
They calling police and they saying that I shot him
Now I'm on the news, cops saying, 'Yeah we got him'
My father complaining, and my mama bawling
There's just the problems, problems, problems
All over the news like Osama Bin Laden (Ayy)
Judgement shall reach them 
All I want is freedom, they don't wanna set me free
And my PO don't want to let me be, got me feeling like he obsessed with me
So I get that done, so I tell em I ain't going back to jail
I ain't going to spend my whole life in a cell
Tryna spend my life doing well, tryna spend my life doing well
Tell me what I got to do, to prove to you
That I'm a changed man, won't do the same thing
Was stuck in my ways, but now I've changed
And them times that left my brain
Da-da-da-da-deh-da-da-deh-da-da-do
Now I get feds everywhere that I goYou might also like2Embed

Fulfilling All Righteousness Lyrics
Feel like I've been on the road for forty days and forty nights
Any decision I make right now must be right
That's why I've been sitting down lonely, thinking bout where I belong
Cause trials and tribulations come but still I'm standing strong

Yeah suns over now feeling cool weather
Warm and keep cool like a new sweater
Check me out, I'm on a work like a newsletter
Ya know I'm good I'm looking better
Long ago was stranded with the criminals
Now SMG, I'm self made general
Stay in my crown, my seat must grow
So hand me my crown cause my seat has the grown
Who you be herе my boys is loud
After the storm, I'll make you firе rain from the clouds
I walked eight miles on my journey to the south
L.A. back to the UK, the dollar in the plan
Feel like I've been on the road for forty days and forty nights
Any decision I make right now must be right
That's why I've been sitting down lonely, thinking bout where I belong
Cause trials and tribulations come but still I'm standing strong

Someone expose himself just for exposure
Me? I just want security and closure
My main man doing ten years for hustling
And he ain't even hustle for ten years
I know guys who've been suffering for ten years
Go on punishment, hustle just the same thing
When I was younger, I was tryna pull up properties
But now I'm getting old, I'm tryna own some property, word

Feel like I've been on the road for forty days and forty nights
Any decision I make right now must be right
That's why I've been sitting down lonely, thinking bout where I belong
Cause trials and tribulations come but still I'm standing strong

Just fulfilling all righteousness
I'm just fulfilling all righteousness
Just fulfilling all righteousness
I'm just fulfilling all righteousness
Sitting down lonely, sitting down and waiting and waiting and waiting
Sitting down lonely, sitting down and waitingYou might also likeEmbed

How old are you now?
(Oh, man)
Glory, yeah
Like the last time that you ever seen me, hold me, ah
Lately, I've been fucked up, been havin' a hard time
Like back when my dawg died
Felt my heart split apart like apartheid
I could have survived, thug life full of combine
Hold it down, I was sentеnced by the crown
And I nevеr used to smile, though I never used to frown
Ten toes on the ground, what the hell?
My life came turnin' around from runnin' wild in my town to the glory

Hold me, ah (Ngiphakamise)
This is my story, yeah (Indaba yami le)
Glory, yeah
Like the last time that you ever seen me, hold me, ah

I remember when they shipped me from the cans
To Chelmsford HMP and my celly had it bad
So I had to have his back, niggas started fightin'
And then they cut me on my hand
So I grabbed one from the back and I flung him off the landing
You know the screws get extra ruthless when you're Black
Layin' on my back, now the block's feelin' mad
Now I'm in a lab tryna do the best I can

Hold me, ah, this is my story, yes
Glory, yeah
Like the last time that you ever seen me, hold me, ah

Said, first things first
I finna let you know that I been bad since birth
I heard it from the nurse
Lookin' and went searchin' through trials that occurred
Then I started workin' twice as hard
Havin' nightmares of the day I fall off
But I stick around like herpes, I ain't lettin' up
With harmonies just like Bone Thugz, ooh

Hold me, ah, this is my story, yeah
Glory, yeah
Like the last time that you ever seen me, hold me, ah
Glory, yeah

This is my story (Glory)

Don't fuck around 'cause my niggas is crazy, they probably all strappеd open up your dome
Elliot sippin' round
Nigga right now this ain't what y'all want
Fuck around make my niggas go dumb
Got the kush rolled up
Lean and soda

Nigga looking like spidey
Got drinks like... on my lap
Broad daylight niggas in the trap
I ain't got time to show niggas no love
No talks, no shakes, no hugs, no defs
All a nigga get is that Rat-tat-tat
This pussy ass niggas ain't know me like that
Now I got your homeboys wearing all black
'Cause you ain't fall back when I told your ass
Don't know what you been told
But when a nigga full clip, unload 'em
Give it to the nigga leave him laying down cold

Guilty LyricsSaid I am guilty of loving you, girl
Said I am guilty of loving you, girl
Said I am guilty, send me to jail
Give me a life sentence, send me to jail
'Cause I am guilty of loving you, girl
Said I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth
I couldn't swear that I never knew
This is how it all started
I met this girl on my way to school
Then we went to her place but I say to you
She dropped her books and I just played the fool
(?)
And now we all grown up now
We separate ways for school and such now
But anytime that you touch down
You go remember me
'Cause I am guilty of loving you, girl
Oh lord, oh lord
Ohhhh, ay
You should've been my wifey
I don't care if anyone else like me
If they don't like it they can die, me nuh care
When you're gone I cry, I swear
Said I miss you very much right now my girl my girl
Ohh I'd
Do anything for you, anything for you
'Cause I am guilty of loving you
Said I am guilty of loving you (only you baby)
When I heard the verdict, I jumped up when I heard it
You'll never please that verdict
Getting a life sentence like I murdered
All because of your love my girl
Do anything for you girl
Don't ever take me for a fool
My kindness for weakness, this is me and you
In this world, all I have in this world is you oooh
You better have my children in the same building
We'll live together in harmony

One time, let it breathe (Oh, yeah)
(Oh, yeah)

If I can do better then I'll be better
Rolling in the deep, I need to breathe better
I see demons in my sleep, I need to sleep better
Having visions of my friends in RIP sweaters
Have you ever had to sacrifice your health?
Ever had to sacrifice yourself?
Plus I got an army full of fools tryna sabotage my wealth
But I know it's self-destructive if I bang 'em by myself, wow
Like, God hold me down 'til I'm downed
God, hold me down 'til I drown (Hold me down 'til I drown)
It's like I nearly fell into the ground
But the holy blood of Christ, you don't ever let me down
Lord knows I'll be back up in minutes and disappear
Wonder if I flip, all my mandem just disappear
Number seventeen on my little list of fears
Then she tells me not to speak and she whispers in my ear like

On Mount Everest shoutin', "Ah"
Soon go back to the mountains; third album
Brother, I bless the beat with smoke
And my day one bros, they kept me close
Then I sip my Tetley, take a toke
They're tryna get me on the ropes
Ayy, bro got the speshy in his coat
So, please, man, let's just be adults
And don't be flexin' in my boat
Brother, you can't test me, I'm the G.O.A.T

Rolex collections lookin' dope, I got the Pepsi and the Hulk
And I ain't flexin' on you, brothers, cah I'll still be sexy, if I'm broke
Wait there, —made to win, —designed to blow
—doin' major things, it's a minor though
Used to pay for things, but that was time ago
—hit you brothers with the Wiley flow, it's like

Bad 'em up, bad 'em up, bad 'em up once
Never could you take me for a dance
Been on the scene for a hundred months, all I met is bare punts
Take man for lunch, idiot youts get punched
Pick one boy from your bunch
Tell man, "Jump!", oh, what, you didn't wanna jump? Well
Oh, well, look, now you're slumped
Lil' brother, I swerve (Ah) (Lil' brother, I swerve)
Get out my lane (Get out my lane)
North and East and West are hot, but the South's on flames
This year, I'ma be a household name
I grew up in a house of pain
I don't do it for the clout or fame
All the real brothers gonna vouch on my name

How Bad Could It Be Lyrics
I'm Jorja Smith and when I'm in a bad mood
I can make a whole room really feel as bad as I do
I overthink, "Why am I in a bad mood?"
"Why has someone put me in a bad mood?"
Loads of whys and no solutions of how to get myself out of a bad mood
Which I'm tryna work on
It's the Nigerian nightmare, Kamaru Usman
And when I am in a bad mood, I love to stop and think
So that I don't make the situation worse
I give myself time to be able to make a rational and educated decision
That'd help me through the situation
When I'm in a bad mood, I tend to be very quiet
And I go to my high power, my God
When it's rainin', you wish the sun was shinin'
When it's sunshine, you wish the rain was fallin'
You're always sеarchin', never seem to find it
Lookin' in all the wrong placеs

'Cause you can't seem to decide whether you're wrong or you're right
And you're just not sure about your life
Get nervous, then anxiety take over your mind
And your trouble just increase in size
When you're feelin' mad and you're angry
When you feel like you're lonely
When you feel as sad as you can feel
Say, "How bad could it be?"
How bad could it be?

Many wan know if you love just her
And you've got way too many scars before me
Search for problems where there isn't any
You're only happy when us breakin' up

You can't seem to decide whether you're wrong or you're right
And you're just not sure about your life
Get nervous, then anxiety take over your mind
And your trouble just increase in size
When you're feelin' mad and you're angry
When you feel like you're lonely
When you feel as sad as you can feel
Say, "How bad could it be?"
Say, "How bad could it be?"
You might also like
Oh, there's a reason why you walk like you don't have a care in the world
All the times in your life that you had to put up with someone like me
Never should have loved you like that
Never should have listened to them there
Because even when it seems suicidal
Always have to listen to my heart

When it's rainin', you wish the sun was shinin'
When it's sunshine, you wish the rain would fall
You're always searchin', never seem to find it
Lookin' in all the wrong places, ah

You can't seem to decide whether you're wrong or you're right
And you're just not sure about your life
Get nervous, then anxiety take over your mind
And your trouble just increase in size
When you're feelin' mad and you're angry
When you feel like you're lonely
When you feel as sad as you can feel
Say, "How bad could it be?"
Say, "How bad could it be?"

Yeah, yeah, it's your boy, Swizz Beatz
Shoutout to my brother, Burna Boy
You know, when I get upset
Disappointed with things sometimes
I just, like, put on some jazz music
Go smoke a cigar
And just go play with the kids, you know what I'm sayin'?
Go and play with my kids
Go out with the wife
Just switch that energy and just know that, you know, too blessed to be stressed
No matter what, you know what I mean?
So, a lot of things that I'm upset with
I think because people just don't know better
You know what I'm sayin'? People just don't know better
So, you know, we gotta know betterEmbed

I Don’t Care Lyrics
Oh lord

And they saying they wishing
That they could just get me sleeping
Put a gun to my head, turn me to victim
I ain't scared even a little
'Cause I don't give a fuck, we're in the middle
I really don't care anymore
I'm feeling like I'm nailed to the floor
I don't know again
Do what you want
Just know I don't care
Somebody hold me 'fore I burst it in his head
Thought he was a G but he talking the victim
So I'm gonna be singing when I'm bursting off the letter
Boom by-by in a party boy, ay
I don't give a fuck, my bandana's fully red
I don't think you heard, I'm repeating what I said
I don't give a fuck, my bandana's fully rеd
If you went and quit it, throw a bag over your head
I bеt you never thought I'd see the sun again
But I'm back now
Sorry but it's over
Get your baggage packed now
Told them get the fuck up out my throne before I sat down
Finally I'm free again, I'm never going back down
Finding snakes and I'm chopping off they head
Smiling in my face
But they wishing I was dead
I ain't gonna rest 'til I empty 'em for red
Make your fuckin' marrows red
Ladies, what the fuck is there

'Cause they saying they wishing
That they could just get me sleeping
Put a gun to my head, turn me to victim
I ain't scared even a little
'Cause I don't give a fuck, we're in the middle
I really don't care anymore
I'm feeling like I'm nailed to the floor
I ain't goin' nowhere
Do what you want
Just know I don't care

No matter how many times I get up
I still seem to fall again

Oh-oh, oh-oh

If you feel it right there, maybe you should air it out
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

If People Must Die Lyrics
Today wi haffi hope and pray
Bad mind people and dem evilest ways
Hear say dem wan mi dead inna di worst ways
Wan see mi whole body lay down ina grave
Buh dat a nuttin mi cyan hangle
See things different from anoda angle
All round time feelin like me gettin strangled
Haffi shute first for my life style dangle pon di edge
Because anytime mi tink 'bout Gambo
I full up a pain and sorrow
So mi haffi ride on solo
'Nuf tears inna mi eyes like
Lord if people must die then why do we cry 'cause I dun wan feel it anymore, mi neva understand that yet
Lord if people must die then why do we cry 'cause I dun wan feel it anymore, mi neva understand that lord

Some of dem find di remedy
Wan assassinate mi like J.F Kenedy, problem
When dem a go find di energy
Friends kill Friends fi one bokkle of Hennessy
So as mi lay my head to rest
Pray to Jah he will protec
So as mi lay my head to sleep
Pray to Jah my soul to keep
How a do dem?
Mi nuh chill mi nuh hangout
Read bible before see me sip wah Jah send out
Troublin times when a friend sell friend out
Anytime me see enuf, tears inna mi eyes like

Lord if people must die then why do we cry 'cause I dun wan feel it anymore, mi neva understand that yet
Lord if people must die then why do we cry 'cause I dun wan feel it anymore, mi neva understand that lord

No matter how bad the situation wi always haffi give thanks to di holy Emmanuel I king Selassie Jah rastafari
Dem say fire burn di pagans dem
Mi coulda never ever be satan friend
Any bwoy wish me bad it a go worse pon dem

Intro Lyrics
So what do you think about Burna Boy?
Fantastic artist but I think he is on a path of destruction
Why?
Well we've all seen it, we've all seen what Burna Boy can do and can't do
Burna Boy can make good music, but Burna Boy can't be a responsible artist
Burna Boy can not keep everything within, as an artist
Controversy has clouded his whole career
It just shows how, I mean
I mean from the progression from how he started
Fantastic music, you know smothered by controversy
Upon controversy, upon controversy, up 'til now
Well he has the hits, and he has that bad boy image
Which goes with the controversy as well
See talent is never enough
Burna Boy is one of the most talented Nigerian artist right now, right?
He makes good music, he's got good lyrics, but talent is never enough
If talent was enough, you know
Majek Fashek will still be number one artist maybe in Africa or the world
We've seen artist come and go
Just because they couldn't keep their career together
You know, only this year Burna Boy has been in say four, four-five controversies
From threatening to kill bloggers
To you know posting pictures of guns on his Instagram
To calling out the MAMAs because he wasn't self-nominated, he was nominated
You know he didn't have any solo nominations
To fighting with reggae artists in Southern Africa
You know and all that, threatening to kill people, I mean
If you, you can't, you can't have all that and have a peaceful career
It doesn't work that way
Controversy will kill youYou might also likeEmbed
 
 
Intro: My Life Lyrics
Ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
I’m gonna try and be a good host right now
Stop by the introduction you know what it is

They call me, They call me
They call me Burna, Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy
Taking it back to when I was younger
And only noticed by my mamma
As onalabahama jumping up and down in the Ghana
Everybody watch me, Nobody turn to me
Everything I do today I learned from there
Other players runned away, now I flipped the script and turned the page
This one is for all of y’all who didn’t know that far
If you ain’t know my name you better do now

They call me, They call me
They call me Burna, Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy
They call me, They call me
They call me Burna Boy

This is just the way I am, this was not my plan
Y’all won’t understand, I’m just an ordinary man
And this is just the way I am

Eh my name is Benson Idoneje and
Burna boy is my grandson
Well he is doing very well
I see that he has started on a very good note
And his music is unique
Even though, Hip-Hop eh, but the pretty good thing about his music is that
It has meaning and so he has a long way
He has something good
This is just the way I am, this was not my plan
Y’all won’t understand, I’m just an ordinary man
And this is just the way I amYou might also likeEmbed

She gone throw the pussy
Imma knock it out the park (Swing)
Remember when I tell you say
This life is a holiday
Some people go sample craze
Some people go runaway
Cause it’s a mad thing when I arrive
Cameras flash when I hop out the ride
Said I’d keep it cool but obviously I lied
They weren’t expecting nothing
When my nigga went to slide
You know I got the juice
You know how I get down
You know how I do
Drip in designer clothes, couple thousand for the shows
Gyal ah take off them clothes

Level Up (Twice as Tall) Lyrics
Oh, I'd have to be twice as tall at least
To feel better than I do
Yes, I'd have to be twice as tall at least
I mean me multiplied by two (By two)
(I mean me multiplied by two, by two)
Oh, I'd have to be thrice as wide at least
To feel better, you'll agree
Yes, I'd have to be thrice as wide at least
I mean me magnified by three (By three)
(I mean me magnified by three, by three)
I've been kinda hazy (Hazy) for days
I remember when I couldn't level up
I was trying, but I couldn't level up
It was rough, you see
Start feeling like I had enough
Then I contemplate giving up (Ayy)
If you're feeling like you can't level up
Omo make you no stop at all
Because right when you start feeling like you can't level up
That's when you haffi shut the devil up
I remember when I couldn't level up
No, my money couldn't level up
Doing what I must, seems like there's always another level up
That's why you always found me looking up
But sometimes inna my life you know me haffi rebel up
Might hear about my fights in the club
Every day me try and level up so me striking them hard
Me go hard until I get to God

Niafer Ko, Djek Djekal ko
You can do it, woah, woah

'Cause the love make me stand up every time when me fall

Some of them still peddle drugs (Run along)
If you know that you ain't never show me love
And you like me better when me gun ah buss

Location Lyrics

If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no
Send me the location
This year ’bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location

Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti

Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I’m laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets

If you send me the location

And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no

I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh

Love, Damini Lyrics
Everything be off the top these days
I ain't write shit since my early days
And inside these veins, my blood, my DNA
Burna Boy, but I'm Johnny Blaze
Ayy, yeah, there's things that I hardly say
"How you been, mama? How's your day?"
I should talk to my granddaddy more before it's too late
Listen more to things that Roni says
Should have been by Buki's side when her mother died
Should have talked to Sound Sultan more before he fuckin' died
I should show people more love while they still alive
I should always know thе way my people feel inside
A lot of timеs, I feel my life's in a blender
So, I tell it black-and-white like a panda
Yes, I agree I'ma start makin' changes, yeah
Tryna be a better man, I been tryin'
I got it all, but I still got my anger
Been workin' hard tryna get rid of my anger
(Ngizo chinja, ngiyenze ngancolo)
Muntu wani ongelo liphutha, thola yakhe emhlabeni
Nami ngina wami amaphutha
(Ngiyavuma ngiwenzile amaphutha)
Nami ngiwayenzile awami amaphutha
(Ngizo chinja, ngiyenze ngancolo)
Kodwa ubani ongenal' iphutha lakhe emhlabeni?
(Vuma, vuma nawe uliyenzile iphutha, vuma, uzo chinja wenze kancolo)
Kodwa ubani ongenal' iphutha lakhe emhlabeni?

I bought a castle in France and it's the same one
I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I need to be loved by you (Oh)
I need to bе loved by you (Need to)
I need to be loved by you (Need to, need to, need to)
I need to bе loved by you

I remember when we started datin'
The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is an every day ting, baby
You and me in different places
Textin' and messagin' and talkin' crazy
When I'm with you, I feel like it's a daydream
That's how I know that you would always be my baby

All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

Monsters You Made Lyrics
If the government refuse to develop the region
And continue the marginalization and injustice
The youths or the next people coming after us
I think will be more brutal than what we have done

Calling me a monster, calling us fake
No way, no way, no way
Calling me a monster just 'cause we said
We're from the block where it rains
Where we create barricades
Keep opposition away
That's why we strapped with  AK's
Don't get kidnapped from your place
'Cause it could happen today
Not knowing how to behave
That is a sign that you may
Just lose your life, what a waste
Your body found in a lake
You fucked around and the fisherman
Found you drowning for days
You know we come from a place
Where people smile, but it's fake
How could they smile?
If you look around, they surrounded by pain
I've seen the sky turn to grey
It took the light from the day
It's like the heads of the state
Ain't comprehending the hate
That the oppressed generate
When they've been working like slaves
To get some minimum wage
You turn around and you blame
Them for their anger and rage
Put them in shackles and chains
Because of what they became
We are the monsters you made
You might also like
Calling me a monster, calling us fake
You make the Minotaur, the dinosaur wake
Calling me a monster just 'cause we said
No way, no way, no way
Calling me a monster, make no mistake
That there's only so much that you can take
La-di-da-da-do-di-da-da-do-day
We are the monsters you made

I bet they thought it was cool
Probably thought we was fools
When we would break all the rules
And skip them classes in school
Because the teacher dem teaching
What the white man dem teaching
Dem European teachings in my African school
So fuck the classes in school
Fuck Mungo Park and the fool
That said they found river Niger
They've been lying to you
Ain't no denying the truth
See what I'm tryin' to do
Is draw the line for the mothers crying
We're dying as youths
Come walk a mile in my shoes
See if you smile at the truth
See if you digest your food
That's when you might have a clue
Of what the fuck we go through
You're fucking lucky if you
Live through the day, better pray
That God always staying with you
Ain't fuckin' safe, any day
The reaper'll be coming for you
We need a change and it ain't no way I'ma take an excuse
My niggas findin' a way
Or fuckin' smile in the grave
This is the price that you pay
We are the monsters you made
Calling me a monster, calling us fake
You make the Minotaur, the dinosaur wake
Calling me a monster just 'cause we said
No way, no way, no way
Calling me a monster, make no mistake
That there's only so much that you can take
La-di-da-da-do-di-da-da-do-day
We are the monsters you made

Since we met you people five hundred years ago
Look at us, we have given everything
You are still taking
In exchange for that, we have got nothing
Nothing
And you know it
But don't you think that this is over now?
Over where?
Is it over?2Embed

Oh aii

Just the dirty politicians
Just give them a pen and the money goes missing
Aii... World's greatest magician
And anything them say, the public have fi listen
That's why mommy is on the kitchen floor
Daddy is sitting wishing for
The time when they will feed their boy
How long them are gonna be a victim for?
Yea, the limit is the sky
I know it looks like it's finished in your eyes
Me no go ever tell a lie
When judgement come and righteousness ri-i-ise again

Everything that's done in darkness
Should surely be brought out to light
Then we go know who's wrong and who's right

But everyone drive pass and ignore us
Doesn't anybody care anymore?

Mehn, it's a waste of our time
The days when my mind is fixated on the crime
And the grime, and the slime and dying and the crying and the ...
Fuck mehn, why am I trying?
Occupy this and occupy that
At the end of the day, there's no real occupant
Fire burn the men who use the poor man pain
And the struggle and his hustle to secure what they want
I hear politics this and politick that
I am reading the budget and me have to laugh
What is it for sir?
Sports, porshe car
When poor man no see food like Oyster
Ha! I don tire
Tire tire brother
Tire tire tire
Man turn to rubber
Rubber go thief
Carry gun fire
Innocent boys them catch am put tyre upon
Oh Lord come handle
Darkness everywhere, me need candle

My Oasis (Live at Abbey Road Studios) Lyrics
This is where we belong
Stood in an empty space
The centre
You are my core
An oasis in the middle of a storm we created
This vessel, empty
Space filled with nothing but longing and hope
You left me with ache
But I am magic
You left me in pain
But in my oasis there is space to dream again
Oh, I have suffered to with those that I saw suffer
Not a hair perished, that may be true
But my mind perishes without the possibility of you
Keep thinkin' that I'm seein' water
You're playing tricks on me in the sun
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done
The desert don't end, the rain don't fall
And I can't pretend I don't want you all
'Cause I want you all
You all, you all, you all

Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (Emotions)
I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean)

But for a future atypical and new
We've been closed for so long

Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you, oh, baby)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you

They call me Burna, Boy
4-O-D

I give my body
It must count for something
Every time I talk 'bout love
You don’t say nothing
What are we doing?
It’s time you start choosing
And if I'm not the one
Please, keep it moving

So in love with my figure
When you’re drinking that liquor
Got me feeling like I’m the bae
But crop me out of your pictures
Can’t be seen in daylight
And you won’t do date nights
Anyone would think you’re ashamed
But it won’t make me cry

As you see, I jejely dey for my lane men
Remember when I used to hope and pray for change, men (Yeah)

Come make I give you tori

'Cause if dem catch my kpoli
Den dem go barb me goris
Give me quit notice

Because I know that I'm the bigger man

Hmm, ha, style wickedest
Whether, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, any time of the week
Hmm, ha, 'time of the week

Come on, come on, have a ball if you act maturely
Ayo, who wanna get invited to a Burna party?
I got a hunnid and eighteen homies who's naughty
So, baby, don't you bring your friends if those chicks are corny
We gets it on 'til the dawn, 'til they say, "This is ridiculous"
Ladies, they love the way we come through in the clutch
Fellas who can't keep up, might as well hit the dust
And haters, bump what they say, they don't mean shh—
Yo, I give three words when I try to scoop her
Then after that, ain't got no time for no party pooper
I keeps it movin' 'cause we zone out and own our own damn lane
Thirty years up in this same game, still doing our damn thang

Heard I'm a earner, had to earn a burner
Trigga nigga, Naughty Nation, marshal arsenal
Never had to use burner-burners
I'm a changed man, still on the gun range
Singing karaoke, wife wearing Dolce
Black fist, pick stuck in my gold teeth
Been winning, befriending woman
From the beginning with a dripping driver
African emblems on the engine, engine, engine
A number runner, every summer, what's hopping with ya option?
Keep it gutter witcha brother
Hey I wanna see fine keles, come jam for me
Not the ones, wey dey form Instagram for me
Say God damn you no go fit, handle me
God go punish, whoever no gbadun me
Because I know that I'm the bigger man
Its why I came looking fresher than a peppermint (Uh)
'Til today I dey the same because I can't change
I be naughty by nature, I be gang-gang

Some people think it's a game, like Connect Four
'Til I rise the ting and dem collect four
I come extort
Give me both, mine and yours
Silent war
'Cause anyone could be next door
I was born naughty by nature
Now I make more
But still me wicked as they come
Your eyes get sore
Why you watch my pockets for?
Watch it (Hmm)
Spaceship Rocket Boys
Runner by nature
Know that shawty bang-bang
New Jerusalem, Africa the same game
Boom bap, boom baye, all the same slang
No protection, no peace, they know the chain game
Bang, bang3Embed

Coz me I'm always talking the fact
I don't do weak flows coz I never lack
You see my flow is always intact
You want to tell my story
When you ain't never ever done shit for me

Truth be said is only crime I commit
But now I speak and they are all astonished

And I'm always working

Outro: Remember Me LyricsJust in case you never know
Burna boy don come to tell you just as e dey go
Dont believe most of the things you hear pon the stereo
Just incase una dey lost make i lead you back to the road
Now who no know go know
I try annahilating all my people waiting
Steady complaining
Everynight and everyday no negotiating
Them steady legislating reconfigurating the way
Do i have to sing you a symphony
Just to make sure that when am gone
You still remember me
So am about to leave my mark as a young boy
Raised up in PH city
Mark as a young boy
Raised up in PH city

Listen cause i guarantee you not heard nothing yet
Had a feeling **** brother ****** debt
When a man have his mind made up a saying right into the dirt
Willing to shed blood and sweat
And you fit *******
***** and you go gladly
And his last words make sure you remember me

Do i have to sing you a symphony
Just to make sure that when am gone
You still remember me
So am about to leave my mark as a young boy
Raised up in PH city

Outside Lyrics
Many different rules outside, you’re new outside (so watch how ya move outside)

You no gon know if you no go
Don’t try reap what you don’t sow
Anytime you dey for road better don’t slow wo wo wo

I can't remember how it happened
Tell me now
And if I feel it any deeper, I might drown
Now I know you can never tell what is going down
From the outside (from the outside)
Outside (from the outside)
Outside, I'm on the outside
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (and and I)
Any deeper (and I may be)

Any deeper (and and I)
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (so watch how ya move)

Outside of the jungle
Look around and no see nobody to run to
Wetin my eyes see for jungle
Look around and no see nowhere to run go
My brothers plenty for the jungle
But dey no know me again for the jungle
My people plenty for the jungle
But its everybody for themselves inna the jungle
Dem mama no go dey there
That's the reason why me tell you say

I can't remember how it happened
Tell me now
And if I feel it any deeper, I might drown
Now I know you can never tell what is going down

Come dey feel like say nobody fit to help me
Like say I dey shout but nobody hear me
Until finally nothing come dey fear me anymore (ye)
If only father God can talk to me
And tell me what he has in store for me
Could he let me know?
Cause only God knows the pain I feel
All day me never eat no meal
Oh all them say the good die young
Now the dead's getting younger
Age ain't nothing but numbers
This life's a jungle sometimes
I really wonder how I keep from going under
So before me mother cry and her eyes start swell
Cause her son end up like Vybz KartelEmbed

A bunch of bitches in the motherfuckin' pool getting wet
All white, all night pop the molly on sight
And this Mandela money got me feeling godly, a'ight?
I like my shit tidy and it's from the gate
Throw the money in the air watch it ricochet
I got the baddest foreign chick on the premises
Now watch it drop to the slip when I say andale, (Andale!)

D-M-R running with a pact that cut mayhem
Don't talk too much, new deeds we vibrant
One turkey, two boby
Man dem go blow the name, we call it nkwobi
Your name might be Ada or Mary Jane
Hook it up, make I under gather rain forest
Keep plots and move like a tourist
Like it when the coochie is foreign

Play Play Lyrics
I know you're in love
Cah mi have di MAC with di extension
And mi have di money fi ya extensions
Cah mi like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh
Know we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

My favorite girl had da French braids
I had a crush on her since back-a-day
She said her 'usna needs a bandage
After I come 'round and gave her the 12-gauge
You tried call my phone, but it was engaged
I was with my lil' mama, she was honey glazed
I've been crushin' on her since back then
Just the other day I gave her the MAC-10
I don't want just any girl, 'cause I'm a little choosy
But I swear I'm a sucker for a lil' cutie
I had a skin fade like Lil Boosie
And then I went and give lil' mama the lil' uzi
'Cause you got a body shape that I can't forget
The way I make you drip when I'm talkin' slick
I'm ashamed 'cause when I came, I was bustin' quick
That's why this time I came with the banana clip
I know you're in love
Cah mi have di MAC with di extension
And mi have di money fi ya extensions
Cah mi like your hair longer than my gun, ooh-ooh-ooh
Know we have di guns and girls, haffi keep di balance
And up in my world, we nuh sleep enuh, man
Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

Only God can judge me, but my friend's a lifer
My life is too fast, so I can never wife her
I'm from the East Coast but she's a Westsider
I scoped her from far 'cause I'm the best sniper
Said she had the melons, so I go and get 'em
Spray with my AK-47
The way she keeps me guessin', she is a blessin'
But she only loves me for my three-fifty-seven
I think she was Bajan or maybe Trini
Every time I linked her, I had a nine milli'
I had to link a cougar with a Luger
But the next time, I bring out the big bazooka
It's the Return of the Mack, call it the sequel
I'm known as the Mack like Beanie Sigel
Before she got undressed, she was already see-through
Then she fell in love with my Desert Eagle

Anytime it could go down, she won't hold out
She let it all out, pow-pow-pow, pow-pow

She love me for my gunplay
From Monday to Sunday (Monday to Sunday)
I keep a girl up on the runway
She love me for my gunplay
But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me
She love me for my gunplay
From Monday to Sunday (Monday to Sunday)
I keep a girl up on the runway
She love me for my gunplay
But if it wasn't for my gunplay
Then she really wouldn't love me2Embed

Pree Me Lyrics
Lately I’ve been on my toes
Enemies been on a mission
Fuck em, I’ma do the most
See them multiplying

So tell me what am I to do
When everybody hate on you
So how am I supposed to feel
When niggas try to scheme on me
Niggas never been real to me
These niggas just make believe
Last night I had a dream
Somebody gave me a time machine
Flew through the times back and forth
Still ain’t change nothing at all
Not even all of my bad luck
Not even all the times I broke the law
Lately I’ve been on my toes
Enemies been on a mission
Fuck em, I’ma do the most
See them multiplying

Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me
Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me

I got a lot of enemies
Some of them used to be my friends
But now they switched sides on me
I wonder why they all pretend
Even though it ain’t clear to me
What’s the gain in the end
Only one things clear to me
Me really can’t trust no friend
So you haffi watch your friend
Some of dem no really wan you reach nowhere
It’s the only the thing I cannot comprehend
There’s a lot going on up in my head
But I wouldn’t change anything
Not even all of my bad luck
Not even all the times I broke the Law

My girl, your shining just like my face, Baby welcome to this side

So what's up, you alright
Pull up, I'm outside
What’s up, you alright
Pull up, girl I’m outside

I've gotta stop slewing, it's true
I've got the kind of power that can have you on the news
I don't want my energy channeled for you
I burn an MC and then I burn another zoot
Big batty gyal, she haffi work, work, work
Say she loves how I give them this work, work, work
I'll say anybody's name if I have to
Cuh I'm not a chicken or a jerk, jerk, jerk
But I'm well-seasoned
Spice is like when I'm pepper squeezing
Every other month, a new nigga reaching
Gbenu e soun, leave it
We ain't got a reason, you didn't have a reason
One time for my nigers that love designers
Clean Everyday, and all my 419-ers
Best way out's through, you can't run when it's sticky
It's bookey everywhere but God still got Chippy, awoh

Real Life Lyrics
It ain't like you hearing it and it's like moving you
You know music is, and the music you making is life
And it's like new life
It's important to me to understand the state of mind
And the life you live
And where you're, you know, where you're at right now

Pull up like "Surprise, surprise it's the President"
Can't you see that I'm in my element?
I might just decide to slide on my enemies
I go along on a glide for the hell of it
I'll bring a different vibe when I'm steppin' in
If a nigga ain't right, I'm correcting him
Everybody know for sure, I'ma take it there
So cross your T's and dot your I's when you're messaging
I never subscribe to guys on the internet
Living for the clout, telling lies to the press again
Better don't take me for the fool, I ain't never been
Don't bother with lies, I'm wise when I'm checkin' in
I'm redirecting dem back to the sender men
Then you go see reality, go start arresting dem
Be like say dem no hear when I was telling dem
Life real, I ain't never like the rest of them
Yes, we are blessed, but it's harder to see sometimes
Tryna find my peace of mind, you said how could we be so blinded?
You just follow your dreams and go live your life
I give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason

So please (So please), please stay (Please stay)
Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave)
Real life is for living but the vibes you've been giving's not free
So please stay
We'll share the whole thing, yeah
Real life is for living, use this life that you're living, be free

I wonder which style dem guys dem go try now
If una never hear my story mek you find out
I know say nobody is an island
But if dem wan fuck you for nyash, mek you no lie down
And I know you fit later realize am
But the way you don dey move I no dey like am
Somebody want to wear the shoe wey no size am
Me, I be Destiny's Child, a survivor
Real, no be China
Come here, I've been the guy
And nothing I ever said ever been a lie
Anytime you see me, look up in the sky
I can see the daylight in the night
When you see a soldier smile, it's a good sign
That's the way it is on the south side
I no go let you slide, no, not this time
But now I'm tryna ride, fuck a good time
Goodbye

Rockstar LyricsWhen I wake up in the morning, yeah, whenever you see me yawning
I know that money is calling
'Cause me, I go rich before morning, yeah
I never wake up early, I got a attitude like fuck you, pay me
All my neighbours complain about the ladies, running around my mansion daily
But I don’t care, stick my middle finger in the air
'Cause I don't care, somehow I make this very, very, clear, ay
Ohh don’t you see that I came from trips all day?
Before my head explodes, I'ma just have to go with the flow, yeah
You won't see me have a lonely night, night
Might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Some kind of idol, people do things that I do
I become the guy all the girls wanna say hi to
And I don't see nothing wrong, sing the lyrics to my song
Every time I sing this song, all the ladies sing along
And I still don't understand this, it's not the way I planned it
In about five minutes I’ll be hitting the stage and stealing the show like I’m a bandit
Ooh don't you see that I came from trips all day?
Before my head explodes, I’ma just have to go with the flow, eh
You won't see me have a lonely night
Might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Suddenly everyone seems nice, nice
It might be wrong but it all feels right
Because ooh, I’m a rockstar baby
Ooh, I'm a rockstar baby
Oh Lord
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Oh yeah
And everybody seems nice to me
And the gyal dem a fight for me (fight for me)
Me say the future looks bright to me

Sam Smith - My Oasis (Traducción al Español) Lyrics
Sigo pensando que estoy viendo agua
Me gastas bromas al sol
Veo tu sombra en el patio
Se queda hasta que el día se acaba
El desierto no acaba, la lluvia no cae
Y no puedo fingir que no te quiero para nada
Porque te quiero todo
A ti todo, a ti todo, a ti todo

Oh, cariño, te necesito de verdad
Mis sentimientos se hacen más profundos
Mi mente está en caída libre
Pero no hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata dе ti
Juegas con mis emociones
Estoy fluyеndo como el océano
Rezo por tu devoción
Porque no hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata de ti
Mi oa, mi oa, mi oasis
Mi oa, mi oa, mi oasis
Mi oa, mi oa, mi oasis
No hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata de ti

Espera un minuto, dime por qué te estás moviendo así
Na, te elijo a ti, pero lo haces muy difícil
Te di mi corazón, lo estás poniendo muy oscuro
Pero no hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata de ti
Lo das por sentado
Mucho silencio, el río no acaba
Porque te quiero todo, sí
A ti todo, a ti todo, a ti todo

Oh, cariño, te necesito de verdad (Oh, cariño)
Mis sentimientos se hacen más profundos
Mi mente está en caída libre
Pero no hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata de ti
Juegas con mis emociones
Estoy fluyendo como el océano
Rezo por tu devoción
Porque no hay nada que pueda hacer cuando se trata de ti

You can ask Ese Or you can ask Ogado
Or you can ask my brethren Dambo
And they will confirm this information
About the trials and tribulations
Me are to go through daily
So in this party I'm going crazy
So everybody put your hands up
And if you dey sitting down stand up

I can get you knocked for a hundred bands
Did a drive-by then they walked in
Pricey on my block, its some Talibans
Put you in a coffin‚ never breathe again
Show you like I tell you
Ask me if I change I tell you "Hell no"
Tatted at my arms to my fucking elbow
Till they free my dawg from the prison cell

Know when I pull up in a Benzo it ain't no rental
Imma blow a couple bands just to make an entrance
Solo date on my calendar‚ check my credentials
All this ballin' might offend ya‚ fuck up ya mental
Thats Balenci on my torso so don't buy the mall so
And the socks and the feet, probably even more so
Never send no shots to me cause I'm doing 10 toes
Imma send a couple shots to whoever sent you
Woi oii

Show you like I tell you
Ask me if i change i tell you hell no
Tatted at my arm to my fucking elbow
Sticking to the code, you know I'm Velcro

Rollie that's a bust down‚ it's full of diamonds
It don't tell the time but its 80 thousand
Bitch I'm rocking houses and large amounts are stuffed in my trousers
Bouncing with all ya spouses, like it around us
Non stop, my ship is tip top
Don't you ever get it twisted for what it is not
Marijuana give me wisdom‚ fee round mi kingdom
Never ever has it been done, you never seen some
Woi oii

Did a drive-by then they walked in
Pricey on my block, its some Talibans
Put you in a coffin, never breathe again (Woo!)

Cartier bust down on my sleeve (On my sleeve)
We can trade gold when I sleep (When I sleep)
Drank codeine, lose speed (Drank codeine)
Walking through the back door, 100 deep
Bet 5 racks on the T (5 racks)
Off that kiddy counter AP (Yeah, yeah)
Givency, Givency, double Gs
Bad bitch come where ever I need (Bad bitch)
Legendary tatted on her knees (On her knees)
40 foreign cars, you won't believe (Skrrt, skrrr)
Diamond-diamonds on my neck, bullets in your torso
Gotta represent the set, fuck it, its on my elbow
Cut from a different cloth, should have been a gigolo
Only run with certified hitters in the circle
Anytime its violence, my niggas start to riot
Chopper get to ringing, can't be quiet
Real niggas always move in silence
Copping out, never I ain't hiding
I was wanna rebel 'til I'm dying
You get wetter than a pool, I dive in
Balenciaga shoes, freestylin'Embed
 
 
Siberia Lyrics
(TheElements)
(AoD)
The bando, it look like Siberia
They catch me, my face, it's familiar
I had my shank in the school cafeteria (Told me turn)

The bando, it look like Siberia (One)
They catch me, my face, it's familiar (One)
I had my shank in the school cafeteria (One)
Them man just talk on the field, they're like Lineker (Turn, turn, turn)
Jakes wanna deal with me like Johnny Dillinger, Dillinger (Told me turn)
They love to make me a prisoner (Told me turn)
I was in prison when bro used to visit me (Told me turn)
Now they got bro and they say I'm the visitor
Come up with needles and cylinders
Fentanyl was bittin' and king fishin'
Didn't do well on my literature (S-s-suh)
Now it's just fire in the booth, no fire extinguisher (S-s-suh)
Fuck the prime minister, the system is sinister
Load up this Nina, this one got a whistler
No cap in my rap, know this story ain't fictional (Turn, turn, turn, turn)
Opps can't write to this principle
I won't lie on an L, but I lie to the 12 (Turn)
Used to lie in my cell, I was writin' my mail
Sat there by my gun and my bitch YSL
If I style in Chanel, shawty's stylin' as well
Do you wish me well?
Ice on my wrist like it swell (Suh, suh)
Opps try drill and they fail
They got my bro fired for bail (Suh, suh)
I guess time, it will tell

The bando, it look like Siberia
They catch me, my face is familiar (One)
I had my shank in the school cafeteria (One)
Them man's just talkin', left field like Lineker (Turn, turn, turn)
Jakes wanna drill me like Johnny Dillinger, Dillinger (Told me turn)
They love to make me a prisoner (Told me turn)
I was in prison when bro used to visit me (Told me turn)
Now they got bro in, they say I'm the visitor
You might also like
I'm smokin' gas like a cylinder, I grip the fifty, like Vivica
I got the packs and I send them down
Ridin' dirty like Chamillionaire
I'm just a greazy Nigerian, I just might fuck up your feelings dem
I make you sick like malaria, I do the road by myself because
I do not fuck with no niggas, I do not fuck with no niggas
These niggas too fuckin' snaky
Makin' me nervous, I'm bitin' my fingers
Mi I no like no drama, because I'm not Jerry Springer
Side-by-side with hammers, airing you out through the window
Black on black with the regalia, I'ma have him swimming with tilapia
'Cause when my enemies die, I get happier
Then I take a private plane out to Mali, yeah
That's my bro at the door, you should let him in
Here go my food, all my bread with him
Here go couple for my enemy dem
Then I throw a middle finger for the government (Yeah)

The bando, it look like Siberia
They catch me, my face is familiar (One)
I had my shank in the school cafeteria (One)
Them man's just talkin', left field like Lineker (Turn, turn, turn)
Jakes wanna drill me like Johnny Dillinger, Dillinger (Told me turn)
They love to make me a prisoner (Told me turn)
I was in prison when bro used to visit me (Oh, yeah)
Now they got bro in, they say I'm the visitor
The bando, it look like Siberia (One)
They catch me, my face is familiar (One)
I had my shank in the school cafeteria (One)
Them man's just talkin', left field like Lineker (Turn, turn)
Jakes wanna drill me like Johnny Dillinger, Dillinger (Told me turn)
They love to make me a prisoner (Told me turn)
I was in prison when bro used to visit me (Told me turn)
Now they got bro in, they say I'm the visitor
Mm, don't pull up around here actin' goofy
You can get shot like a movie
You can get hit with a two-piece
Your block get spun with a Uzi
Bang, bang, bang, oww
You can get shot in the mouth2Embed

Sometimes, you love too hard
Sometimes, you go too far
Now I won't want you if you need me
Real things do not come easy, no

Hear me now hear me now
Say boy I do what I do
And them you never call me back

Feeling for what we do but when the carny drops
Sitting in them carny drops
Nobody never did it when I done
Listen to me no one told me something magical
Something is wrong and the fact is bring me down

Solid Lyrics
Yeah

You the type I really vibe with
So I'll forever keep it solid
We go public or keep it private, yeah
Ain't no hesitation about it
No competition, they ain't got it like you got it
So I'll forever keep it solid
We go public or keep it private, yeah
Ain't no hesitation about it
And if I dey for you, na forever
We go dey vibe long as we dey together
Baby, no time, you know it's now or never
'Cause, baby, the way your body dey bounce no regular
There's ups and downs, but who said I'm perfect?
Love is beautiful, but it comes with hurting
The keys and purses may defeat the purpose
Love is really deeper than meets the surface, yeah

You the type I really vibe with
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or move in silence, yeah (Shee)
It ain't no hesitation about it
No competition, they don't got it like you got it
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or keep it private, yeah
It ain't no hesitation about it

Uh, you know the streets I'm juggling
But you the only piece I'm puzzling
Girl, you dey give me peace, no trouble, yeah
It's your choice, get a Rolls-Royce Cullinan
You know the bag gotta keep on coming in
Promise the only time I need to run it up again
I gotta make the streets freeze 'fore the summer end
I hope you understand, bring you back another win, yeah

And if they ask, yeah
Make sure you don't lack, yeah
Make sure you on task for it, don't cap on it
I like it when you brag on me
This shit deep for real
Deeper than what they see for real
I'm playing for keeps for real
Queen recognize queen for real
That's me for real
And they ain't know how to treat you
They ain't know how to keep you
Everyone before might as well keep score
On how to please you, maybe they ain't see you

You the type I really vibe with
Hold me down, I'll forever keep it solid
We can go public or move in silence
Ain't no hesitation about it, about it

'Cause, baby, the way your body dey bounce no regular
There's ups and downs, but who said I'm perfect?
Love is beautiful, but it comes with hurting
The keys and purses may defeat the purpose
Love is really deeper than meets the surface, yeah1Embed

Streets of Africa Lyrics
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
If you put speakers in my mind
I bet it would sound like (whoa whoa whoa!)

That's why I smoke smoke smoke
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow
That's how a nigga keep it cold
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
Even if I don't have no money
My nigga Tundi buy the bar
Back home they call me Oluwa Burna
Cause I'm so awesome, you should know
Always be on my Speed Darlington
You know me, I'm no regular
Bangdadadang when I step in the room
The ground beneath you shaking up
Soon as your wifey seen me and my crew
She said you're breaking up
18 karats on my earlobes
Make it hard to put on earphones
Haters talking, I don't hear though
With the game, I'm like Carmello
Pull up on girls like hello, whoa whoa

I'm Fela Kuti with the hoes
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow
Shout Luciano, that's my bro
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
If you put speakers in my mind
I bet it would sound like..
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How can I not be happy all day?

Make all the gyal dem go loco
Somebody call the po-po, no!

I'm Fela Kuti with the hoes
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow

Sunshine Riptide Lyrics
I don't even have my own attention
You say, "Please don't ever change," but you
Don't like me the way I am, the sign says "Don't you tap the
Glass," but I read it in reverse: "eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT"

The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me, but you know I
Wouldn't let it, it tried to teach me the hard way, I can't forget it
Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in, the pills are kicking in
She said, "I love you 'til I don't"
I am just playing house, no idea what I'm doing now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me, it's time to throw in the towel

'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright, the sunshine

Call me Oluwaburna, I fell in love, but I didn't fall down
Them say me nah normal, drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan
Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain, passing through my fuckin' mind
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through, got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...

The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright

I love you so much, it's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown, petulant, but irreverent

Take all your possibilities then take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in, the pills are kicking in

'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light

True Story Lyrics
Action
Pull up in a white ghost like I'm Casper
Never switch
I stay ten toes on the mission
Fiction

You think say this be music e be real movie (Real movie)
No for rethink discretion e be blue movie (Blue movie)
This no be fictional, based on a true story (True Story)
I just want a Range Rover Autobiography (True Story)
True story trapping never been foolgazy
Stand behind these bars like a nigga Luke Cage
Ghost like the Revеrend never madе it through flames
On my grizzly, Lagos city look what you made
Made something out of nothing, a magician
Tap my wrist, threw my shot, gave my lily
Nine to five, ain't my grind, I'm a villain
Money bags, body bags make a killing
These niggas on some dumb shit, talking cavalier
Bragging bout' how they run shit, I'm like (pew) where?
Coulda been to some but hope build a few career
Be payin' juice for years, streets owe me some arrears
They did a 3p in the league, go on check it
I run every PC's in the list, for the record
And I'm drowing knee deep in the streets more blessings
'Cause they said the dream is free but the hustle? So separate

You think say this be music e be real movie (Real movie)
No for rethink discretion e be blue movie (Blue movie)
This no be fictional, based on a true story (True Story)
I just want a Range Rover Autobiography (True Story)

Somebody shoulda say something
If a nigga ever drink poison
You'll do am sef go begin purging
You know my life no be simple thing
Baby me no like that
'Cause dem no like when me wear bling bling
Some people think say na singing thing
But this be celestial handwriting
Yeah
Everybody know say me bad (don't know man harder around)
I stay ten toes, now the sun blown (ain't no one to hold my hand)
Gun dem a Brad in a man
"Cause we no fling kicker, me no fight Jackie Chan
Solid where me stand
So me roll with the plan (stay higher than a holy man)

U Madt Lyrics
You're mad
You're, you're, you're mad
Me say you're mad why

Yes I know my lyrics is dribble
Man, I freestyle me no have time for no pen and pattern scribble
How many times I sing your girl come to the club and wiggle?
And she come gimme love a little
I'm man, I pretend to her a little little
When I come for drive in my car, I'm passing her
She's hopping down me car, I'm go with her
When she bends over sitting like a tiger
Yo, back to the basic fact
You're just rat
My fat to five are gone club
My real Gs are idiots
I'ma no say your girlfriend hot
Some are coming in thinking crab
I'm no taking like but a crab, crab
I'ma know say mine coming at me just exciting
And, and see the girl dem giving me inviting
Statement of the fact that I'm liking, liking, liking
Have a spear like a viking
Paparazzi everywhere when you see me arriving
And they want to know what I'm wearing or car I'm driving
They don't even give a fuck of how the way I'm surviving
So what I go strike them like thunder and lightening
Yo, I'ma go back to the lighter fact
Understand me sing writing that
No, nobody is writing that
Fight me then I'm fighting back
I know that I might react
Bring me into the yes contract
And I'm like no I'm not signing that
Call me your favorite artist all you want but I'm still not designing that bullshit
That's what we did Picasso define it as
You're mad
Don't close your eyes, there's enough comment on love when you smile
Feel for themYou might also likeEmbed

Bad man at it... and I bring machete
Fuck it, price gun from St. Annes
Bad man-ah... with the tings and the rocket
3 piece each inna head 
 capital not budget oh 

Lord you've been gracious
You my oasis and though the fire blazes
This road I take is gon take all my patience
Its outrageous, that nothing changes
 Behind the matrix
Mind races through 99 stages
You how wild space is
My eye dilations, fine traces
It's like blind illustrations
The black and white pages the night rages
I'm writing pages my pen is like flying white 
Yeah, its outrageous, that money changes
Home is the Vegas, Satan was the holiest of angels huh
The fire blazes, my body racing
Its funny paces, I going breakless, my body races
I rhyme before a thousand angels, I found the basics
Balanced applications move round limitations
Huh, imagination, imaging waking
Somebody taken, it's levitation your body aching huh

Civilization has been caught up in a sticky situation
My mind races through 196 nations
Its outrageous, how you gon hate us?
You know how wild space is
Its like a book without pages
Shoes without laces, whose gon outpace us?
Gracious, like BIG you showed me what Faith is
You know we attainers even though we famous
How you gon hate us? You now rocking with the greatest
Yes you in the ring and you boxing with Joe Frasier
Addicted to the grind and making the show paper
The flow waker, seen what the dough made her
The soul shaker, alpha, the omega
You know greater, make music and blow later
The whole acre, now we need more paper
Is no haters, its the flow violator
Mama used to  like the old vibrator why?
Oh wow, live now and die later
So even if the... wind blow and I waiver
The violator, nigga live from Nigeria
In prison but I'm smoking a blunt with my jailer
Alpha omega, let it bounce (pon pon)Embed
 
 
TranslationsPortuguêsWant It All Lyrics
I've been trying to achieve

Remember when they said they don't believe in me no more?
I was sleeping on the ground, on the cold floor
Whole time I was grinding, I been tryin' to achieve
Working night and day, you know my people no dey sleep
I got every Louis V collection from Virgil
Now my life a fashion show, no rehearsal
Dior from Kim Jones, Bottega from Daniel
100K my ring so I'm not shaking no hands, no
Really rich but grind like I ain't got shit at all
I give them just a little, but now I want it all
It's already won when they ask what I ball for
For all the times you no pick up whеn I called ya
I know when I came in to this world, I was solo
So to mе your opinion na your nyash-hole
Don't vex because I said I did it to my own, oh
If I enter fire now shey una go follow
I'm tellin' you, back in '09 I was feeling so low
No lie, no cap, God knows
No dey talk like say you know, because you no know
If he was here right now, I'll tell you ask Gambo

Remember when they said they don't believe in me no more
I was sleeping on the ground, on the cold floor
Whole time I was grinding, I been tryin' to achieve
Working night and day, you know my people no dey sleep
I got every Louis V collection from Virgil
Now my life a fashion show, no rehearsal
Dior from Kim Jones, Bottega from Daniel
100K my ring so I'm not shaking no hands, no

In my stomach, butterflies
Ain't been the same since my brothers died
We woke up like fuck it, let's slide
Never put a ho above the guys
I have dug deep into your heart, and I discovered lies
They gon' tell my story, I'm that nigga, what they summarize
I came out a winner, I don't care what happened otherwise
Long nights I remember we don't ask to let them cutters ride
Made it out the gutter, can't go back to what I used to do
We just get money, fuck hoes, you know, the usual
And this shit forever, can't accept the thought of losin' you

100K my ring so I'm not shaking no hands, no

Can't believe I really came home with a Grammy
I was in the mansion celebrating with the family
You don't come from where I'm from, you may not understand me
Obviously I never cared about your understanding
Got the biggest honour from Port Harcourt City
Whole time I was there, I was just looking at my daddy
Felt like nothin' else seeing him as proud he can be
I get emotional when I talk about my daddy
Who'd have thought I'd take it this far?
Did it all with my art and it came from the heart
Now they take me to court
But it's cool because my Richard Mille is now worth half a mil
And the price goin' up so I don't need no love

Remember when they said they don't believe in me no more
I was sleeping on the ground, on the cold floor
Whole time I was grinding, I been tryin' to achieve

Fu-fu-fu-fu (Oh)
Funkula

I no be one of those men wey dey fear toto fuck yash
Check am, na kpakoro pa

Buried six feet under coal tar

Aje, why we no go jaiye? Oh, wetin dey sup
Tell my broda jeun soke, everything is okay, oh, wetin dey sup
To ba je, nkan to bafe je is allowed, oh, nothing dey sup
Abajo, toni kin ma so mo, oh, wetin dey sup
As I no fit depend on talk
Dem go disrespect on top
Then I show dem wetin dey sup
As I dey my own
Una no know wetin dey come
You're waiting in vain
I'm overtaking again

Start to dey dance
Put your cap to the back
If you know, say "na kpakoro kpa"
'Cause I came with the gang
Dem know say we bad to the max
We no come here to come gallivant
I dey tell paddy man
'Cause I wise like elderly man
If you no think am well, you go hang
Dem go wan carry chance
Wey you give dem spoil your dance
As for me that one no be my plans

Wetin dey sup, wetin dey play

Wetin you hear, wetin dem talk
I'm watching my back and facing my front
Truth dey bitter, needing no salt
'Cause e no be rice and beans and kpomo
Me and my people don dey consult
Make we dey understand wetin dey sup

Poisonous like a long python

We never liked the sound of dem sirens
They only respect the money and the violence
So I get to show dem wetin dey sup

I no be one of those men wey dey fear toto fuck yash
Check am, na kpakoro pa
Me I know say everybody got to die one day
Buried six feet under coal tar
Make nobody tell my people make we try cool down
But if no be for the sake of one or two things
You sef know say na down you go down

Wetin dey sup, wetin dey play
I no pay attention of course
Wetin you hear, wetin dem talk

Whiskey Lyrics
Port Harcourt resident, they are not breathing fresh air
My people make una dey see am
Say, "Port Harcourt resident, they are not breathing fresh air"
So when you wake in the morning, you go cough
You go cough black soothe
The cars, if you see the way the cars
Them go dey black everywhere
Curtain everywhere, na so everyday na him
We dey mop glass, every day
I fall too easy, and I poured the whiskеy
But no be disability, oh, no be disability, oh
I fall too easy, and I pourеd the whiskey
But no be disability, oh, no be disability, oh

Some people bind and cast
Some of them pray and fast
See pastor don dey fat
Shey na the thing wey God command
Because of oil and gas, my city so dark
Pollution make the air turn black
Every man have to stay on guard

I fall too easy, and I poured the whiskey
But no be disability, oh, no be disability, oh
I fall too easy, and I poured the whiskey
But no be disability, oh, no be disability, oh

People dey sleep for their house dey get no work
Some they walk on the other side of town, dey dem for hold up
Some they pray for the traffic, make dey hail you make you show love
When e reach when to go back home you go-go club
I no say e no easy, my brother
Cuz you dey take am easy, my brother
As long as you are breathing, my brother
As long as you no sink inside water

Rain dey fall for another man place and e no stop

All the things wey him get for his house many don lostEmbed

Calories burning, spliffs in the morning, baby I′mma spark a joint
Then we fuckin on the moon feeling paranoid
Cumming all over the fuse seeking asteroids, stars and the asteroids
Collide that big back, now she moaning tell her friends, that's a???

Wild Dreams Lyrics
Woke up covered in sweat from havin' these wild dreams
Where I'm from, bright lights, they tend to be hard to see
Oh, I pray for strength, please let it wash off of me
I can't help myself from havin' these wild dreams, yeah

Yeah, kept to myself, did nobody no harm
Unless dem was really deservin' it
Come from a place where you can't even sleep
Talk less of even dream in it
Dem na bеlieve in themsеlves den now
How can they now believe in me?
All of my blessings from God
Still don't know what He sees in me
Ooh, I see so much further than what's in front of me
Whenever I fall asleep

Woke up covered in sweat from havin' these wild dreams
Where I'm from, bright lights, they tend to be hard to see
Oh, I pray for strength, please let it wash off of me (Wash off of me)
I can't help myself from havin' these wild dreams

Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild dreams

I dey feel like a steel water where dey run deep
Because the life I dey live today never come cheap
I feel like it's taken something from me
Have to sacrifice if you want become me
Life is a ride, I take the front seat
Let the most high drive, He can't go wrongly
Highs and lows, na lows dey won't see
But those same lows nah make the song sweet

Ooh, I see so much further than what's in front of me
Whenever I fall asleep

Don't let them tell you you too proud or your dreams are too big
You should humble yourself, humble your dreams
Remember everything you see today at some point in time started from a wild dream
At the same time, wild dreams are dangerous to people
Who can't see further than what's in front of them
Remember, Martin Luther King had a dream and then he got shot1Embed
 
 
Winter Lyrics
Ain't nobody ever left my town
That'll be the day I let 'em put me in the ground
Baby I'll be gone with the winds of the Winter

All black shades on 'cause I'm on some Bob Dylan shit
Heart broke at eighteen, still feelin' it
They tell me don't you forget where you came from
But how could I forget? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh you think you boys are famous?
You just on some fake shit
Always doin' the same shit
All you girls are basic
I'm out in LA shit
But ain't on no LA shit
Catch me with the same clique
All it took was patience, yeah
Fuck a cigarette, roll up a Backwood (A Backwood)
And fuck the internet I'm from the backwoods (Backwoods)
Yeah, fuck a cigarette, roll up a blunt please
And fuck the internet I'm from the country
Ain't nobody ever left my town
That'll be the day I let 'em put me in the ground
Baby I'll be gone with the winds of the Winter, yeah
Ridin' through the city on my own
Probably never gonna find a place to call home
But still I'll be gone with the winds of the Winter

Yeah
Everyone's in danger
Ridin' with the bangers
It's crazy what we came from, hatred and anger
Niggas on the back block
With a hunnid laptops
And a couple bank cards
Nigga that's that scam art, that part
Young boys collectin' big amounts
Wire it all to different accounts
Please don't be offended by the way I'm actin' now
I might show up unannounced
'Cause it's static with some niggas from the other side of town
I ain't scared, I rock my jewelry everywhere (Everywhere)
I don't give a fuck, I'm from the third world (Third world)
And fuck the internet, I'm really outside
So don't you ever try to play about mine

Ain't nobody ever left my town
That'll be the day I let 'em put me in the ground

They wear their ray ban
So they need Versace shirt
Happy is the nation
Dem play me song for TV and radio station
Dem a see me risen in the stereo still done
And they talk

On the road to greatness

Some of them a hire private investigator

Eh eh eh

I tell them no be by force

Then they tell me say this music industry simple

No be say I wan blow with one track
And my music fade away
And I no fit come back

To say I don die
But 2012 I sign the contract

This one na gbedu wey dey ja pata
Me, I no get time, I dey da pada
Dada cover my face, calling me Lagbaja
Biggie man, wey no dey wear agbada, ahn-ahn

Tell me, tell me
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon or de Bentley?
The gyaldem riding with me
I no fit die for nothing
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon or de Bentley?
The gyaldem riding with me
I no fit, die for nothing

Ahn-ahn, make you know say
Anything wey you do, dem must commentate (I can't come and kill myself)
So anything wey I dey do
I dey try to dey do am my way (I can't come and kill myself)
Plenty, plenty, plenty suffer wey we face
Just to make sure money dey

But my people dem go say
I no want kpai, I no want die
I no want kpeme, I want enjoy
I want chop life, I want buy motor
I want build house, I still want turn up

The gyaldem riding with me

Different things dem happening, schemes and packaging
In a one night, four shows, I'm juggling
Flow like the ocean, my boat I'm paddling
Shout out Shina Peller, that's my bro, my family
Frozen chains
When it comes to money, I dey concentrate
Make I tell you straight: You are not my mate
If you be commissioner, I be head of state

But my people dem go say
I no want kpai, I no want die
I no want kpeme, I want enjoy
I want chop life, I want buy motor
I want build house, I still want turn up
Tell me, tell me

Your Choice Lyrics
Not gonna lie but this might be dying
Surprised 'cause I thought you were alright
Feels like every night we're fighting
No, please don't sigh
Yeah, it's all fine

Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine
Everything is bless
Last night full of happiness
Pon the bed, we a kiss and caress
After the sex, your phone deh pon the side ah me a rest
And this morning you get a text
And even though me vex
Me nah gon' say nothing, me nah gon' stress
Me just a reason with your conscience
I got to know, oh my girl, I know

Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine

Nunna, nunna, nunna

Every time my phone rings

Mek me tell you all the facts
Cah you never know say me bad
Original foundation badman
Me know say you a freak
And you need a thug inna di sheets
You know say me a thug inna di street
Got everything you need
You know I'm the man, I'm your man
And me nah play number two
So why do you want it?
You can keep rocking the boat
It's like we're listening to Aaliyah
The way we go back and forth

I know you're bad like Marilyn Monroe
I see fire in your love
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
