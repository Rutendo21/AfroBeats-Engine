Strapped up with the guns and the swords and things
Bring hеll to anybody wey try test me

Red Flags Lyrics
I don't know what you think this is
I don't know what you think this is
TSB
Don't know, yeah

See, don't know what you think this is
Is it love or lust? Baby, I don't know which is
Thought I told you I can't fulfill your wishes
I'm a fucking star on every girl's wishlist
But you never for once listen
You're not the only one, got several bitches
But, before I go, take some kisses
I never doubt the fact say I love you pieces
She said, "Ru, baby, this ain't you, you're not the sweet guy I once knew
Tell me what changed, did I do anything wrong, or you just don't love me anymore?"
She said, "Ru, baby, this ain't you, you're not the sweet guy I once knew"
Why did you changе so bad towards me, you've been treating mе like shit?"
Me tell her say—

You saw the red flags, baby, but you ignored the red flags
Now you're here, baby, you con dey vex
See I can't change, baby, you better rest or you end this now
You saw the red flags, baby, but you ignored the red flags
Now you're here, baby, you con dey vex
See I can't change, baby, you better rest or you end this now

Ah, baby girl no time, you gotta end this now
Let's stop lying, omo say na true talk, oh, I no fit settle down
Time's not on your side, ah
Shut the clock
I know you fell in love with my cock and Glock
I'm a billion reasons why we can't work, oh baby

She said, "Ru, baby, this ain't you, you're not the sweet guy I once knew
Tell me what changed, did I do anything wrong, or you just don't love me anymore?"
She said, "Ru, baby, this ain't you, you're not the sweet guy I once knew"
