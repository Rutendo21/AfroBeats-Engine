Brixton Boy Lyrics
Who else?

These niggas wanna make love, wanna cuddle up
I'm on the roads every day to get my money up (That's right)
Real trappin, I just give it to the young bucks
I still dress like I'm real, I don't give a fuck
They get cracking when I say shot caller
Broke-broke nigga but I turned to a baller
She call me daddy, I ain't even got a daughter
Money come first then the catty come after (Woo-hoo)
Baby, I'm a Brixton boy
Sticks and toys
Block's active, we've been making noise
Been a good day, let me bun a big joint
Cah when I check the bank, had to thank my Lord
Cah nigga I was low, I remember counting pennies
No chicks, no hoes, never had a jezzy
Blacked out, strapped up, rollin' with the semi
Now I'm shuttin' down shows all the time, are you ready?
This is the life I chose
I don't really wanna no drama
Lord save me from my foes
I don't really wanna no yawa
Mi mean dis is the life I chose
I don't really wanna no yawa
Lord save me from my foes
I don't really wanna no yawa

Anything I do manna try to come first
Ain't a money move than I ain't concerned
Gyallie on me, they be pullin' on my shirt
I'm a Brixton boy, play around and get burnt
She whines and twerks
Says she wanna crash out, and she don't wanna get hurt
Man nah done beefin over turf
I really like the lifestyle, and I really like the flavours

Lookin' for man, better leave me alone
When you callin' me a dog, I ain't giving you the bone
You was tryna link, I was in my zone
Now I'm growin' up with Jake I ain't thinking about a home
Passion in my veins, you can see it in the blood
Got seed up in the air, finger and a funnel
Growin' up with Bam and he's givin' me a cramp
Lil' shawty is a 10
Lady and a tramp

But so am I, and the brays got my chest on burn
She drops it like, where'd you learn?
Don't rush the ting cah baby gyal was soon your turn
It's mad how I'm feeling her
But I ain't sucked ting cah, you see, the P's come first

I know a lot of girls got it in for me
One dark, one light, like into me
We ain't gonna swipe left can't tinder me
How you know my mob deep like Infamy
Ah, babe, come and chat to me
You could do with some charge in your battery
See yuh likkle pum pum looks fat to me
And I be sendin' out crates like a factory

Groupie Lyrics
I got so many girls in my life
So many girls in liife
I've seen so many girls in my life
So many girls in my liife
Some of them dey lie die
Some of them dey fine die
Some I’d be panshing them till I die
Omo no go dey sky dive oh
No go dey loose guard
So no go dey sky lack
If you no get, get the raba
She go just dey chache kala for you and japa
She’s nothing but a groupie
All she got is just her coochie and Gucci
Always acting bougie
All she got is just her coochie and bullshit

Yo baby, tell what you want I’ve been patient
If you’re only for the money just say it
I can give a little cash but she’s set up like a bank
And all I really ask is don’t play me
'Cause I ain't never lied to you, never did I say that I was wifying you
Never did I say that I wa-
You been known what it is, you’ve been known what it is

So many bad things that me and this girl a done
She like it when hit like wizzy album
She say anytime she sit up on me with her bumbum
She say me so sweet me, me sweeter than drum
Me like it lowkey when I bring the hammer
Me call her Shatta Wale, Tattas from Ghana
She smoking my Havannah see ma soft pyjamas
My phone on flight mode, I don’t want no drama no
Baby do you fuck with me cos of the doe?
'Cause the way you’re taking that booty down to the floor
It’s unlike any booty I’ve ever seen before
This booty don register to vote, e too mature
Back to matter, Ox on the chorus
Party don dey scatter, whether she love me or not it don’t matter
Tonight, she gonna treat me better than her father
You might also like
She’s nothing but a groupie
All she got is just her coochie and Gucci
Always acting bougie
All she got is just her coochie and bullshit

All black beamer, It’s the zodiac killer
All these different girls wanna co-star in my
Movie, thick girls get low far dinner
Four course meal for slim chicks and gold diggers
Slim thick chicks get a medium rare
You see the red in the middle when she throw that bigger
Ass hang all day like she ain’t got a job
Wanna listen to that Adekunle gold track sinner
Every time she needs money to fill up the void
Tell her to kill that noise, we both self employed
Go play with your baby boys, can’t play with these set of toys
Can’t buy you those Gucci bags, save it for dem lekki boys
My life is a movie shot on celluloid
All my money digital but not in coins
I don’t mind if she’s a groupie but keep acting like I’m bougie
Girl you get your set destroyed

She’s nothing but a groupie
All she got is just her coochie and Gucci
Always acting bougie
All she got is just her coochie and bullshit
She attracted to bottle poppers and Benz drivers
I call her Covid legs, easy to spread the virus
The sparklers on the bottle gets her mo wetter
Real niggas know better
You want her then Moet her
Her man really in love with a christmas agenda
She in the streets putting the D in dirty december
Met her upstairs at paper she hit the DM
Next day she with Q at W in his BM
That pussy pricey, high unlikely, that’s she’s wifey
Keep her icy, she’ll be your side chic
But she’s a hustler and all cheque’s cash the same
Respect the game go head shawty do your thing

So many girls in my lifeEmbed

Swear IsDatBoy Justyc
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much, and that's an issue
Couldn’t remember what i told you
All i want is to bite and kiss you
Your Friends do lie and try to trick you
Moment gone, you know I miss you
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to city in broke-down cars
So, baby Girl just pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
From your roommate back in Boulder
Our love is getting stronger
We ain't ever getting older

Take the money but hold on to my soul
Got conviction, you can tell from my flows
Step on the stage, and I’m killing ‘em shows
Real life, no use faking it bro, only real ones will know

Mine Alone Lyrics
You're now rocking with the SDC it's the Show dem camp, omo yes indeed

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load oh, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone oh, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha

True say a bad man was never too good at algebra but our first date just broke the hex
When I took your number and we cracked the formula of reasons why you should replace my ex
Now you got the boy tripping, retrace my steps
Quick SWOT analysis, let's weigh up strengths
Down to risk it all girl, I'll place my bet
That you check every box, you're like my favourite crepes
Let's see, you're soft-spoken and your heart's golden
The way your arch's poking, baby lord knows that
I can slow stroke the weight off your shoulders
Love the way you super soak it, osmosis
I caught the bug and no, it's not COVID
You're like a drug and I need more doses
Now catch yourself, let's play with your rose and
Drown in the sea of love, our hearts woven
Shout out to my-
Omayima, baby, omayima carry load oh, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone oh, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha

I need fire be my lighter
Girl I've been lonely, o tojo męta
You be the reason for my laughter 'cause all the hustle and the pain make me wan kolomental
See, the feeling real I no fit forfeit am
Na you I dey talk about for my twitter
I wanna be with you all day, na you be go my shawty for days, oh no

Omayima, baby, omayima carry load oh, omayima
Na she be my kele, she no dey for everybody
Omayima, baby, omayima, mine alone oh, omayinma
Oma ah ah omalicha

Listen
I'm gonna start up by saying you look bad you know
Lowkey you're not even trying to brag you know
Your beauty had Olodumare in his bag you know
The way you're moving got a G running mad you know
Let's take a palmwine trip girl the runway clear
If forever na the aim, it's a long way there
For my queen I go wan break bread, let's get closer like oxlade said,
Walahi my vision girl e don dey clear
Build a future we can one day share that's real talk
Pray in ten years time we're still soft
Came and you changed my life, I'm still shocked
Many pies throwing eyes at guys, I'm still yours so-

Na money be the root of all evil
But na still money dey send person go school
Money be the root of all badness
But na still money wey turn OBO to baddest
Na money dey commot person for single
And when I get money I go fit drop my single
Hmmm wele wele It's very simple
So when I get the money all of them go fit to mingle
Kirakita no dey get the power
Na calamity dey make person dey sour
I no say me I no get the power
But when I get the rabba I go get all of the power

If I do mistake get money
People go sabi -who I be
If I do mistake get money
People go sabi -who I be

But life's a marathon you've got to pace yourself to win it
And faith in God is the key to knocking doors off the hinges
'Cause my health is my wealth

Seni her gördüğümde dalarım yine uzaklara
Her yer evim gibidir yanımda yine sen olduğunda
Gel de bir gör sensiz halimi
Sen yine güneş ol yanalım ateş misali

Maalesef bırakamadık oluruna

Saralım, saralım hadi en başa
O ilk öpüşme, ilk bakışma
Saralım, saralım hadi en başa
Gözlerin gözümde derin omzumda

I know that you really dont love me no more
Never forgetting used to be my 
Come closer baby, come here

Schumacher Lyrics

Que des paroles, Schumacher
Ça fait parti de tous les surnoms que tu m'as donné
Jusqu'à ce jour où tous les malheurs
À la porte de l'appartement sont venus sonner
Je sais que depuis, tu me hais
Je sais que depuis, t'as tout jeté par la fenêtre
Depuis entre nous c'est plus trop la fête (c'est plus trop la fête)
Tu sais j'ai beaucoup écrit pour gommer mes fautes
Je suis qu'un homme donc je fais des fautes
Tu mе méprises tu m'as mis sur le côté
Disons que jе n'ai aucune chance de me racheter
J'ai beaucoup écrit pour gommer mes fautes

Ojini
(Oxlade)
What’s it gonna cost for you to be mine?
Ooh ooh
I’ve been looking for you, two four seven
Baby girl tell me what’s the level, oh
Whenever I see you girl I’m in heaven
I see heaven
(Alpha)
My guys said don't mess this up man, she special
I thought I had the one, I done seen several
My heart been boiling like a tea kettle
I guess no spoon is long enough to eat with a she-devil
Our matter was water under the bridge, sea level
Sittin’ on the love clouds, used to see heaven
Talking bout a future with cribs and kids
You took it all to the guillotine, where are we headed?
Baby I had to burn the bridge, but you struck the match
The smoke never cleared, you were puffed and passed
Told me you had baggage, I was like fuck the past
I felt lucky to have you, we need more than luck to last
Facts
(Oxlade)
Tell me what you want oh, because
I’ve been looking for you, two four seven
You steady tell me say you no dey, you no dey available oh
And I say anytime I see you I see double
Oh my girl I see double
So what’s it gonna cost to be your man?
To be everything you want oh
How far na, answer na
So what’s it gonna cost to be your man?
To be everything you want oh
Everything you call for

Peep this sonnet, I’m on my Hamlet
See one good thing about a love lost is the fact is
You’re blessed enough to have had it
Cos some people go their whole lives without it
Granted, you had her back like a cold day, you were her jacket
That couldn’t help unpack all that emotional baggage
No captain save-a-ho, thought she ain’t a ho, so won’t panic
Thought you had strength for both so you could manage
Boy, were you wrong
That’s the reason for this here ballad
Wouldn’t say that it’s callous
Just love hard and give a fuck harder man, call it balance
Cos these days, Naija babes run plays three ways
Keep them on rotation like DJs
One’s for the D game
Safety net brothers usually pay
The one who dies there is probably the main
Alpha, better peep game
You gotta live and learn
That babe was never yours, baba it was just your turn
But the lesson is the blessing, young blood
That’s my word
(Oxlade)
And I say anytime I see you I see double Oh my girl I see double
(Alpha)
Yeah
Neither of us was Innocent, we just flipped a new page
But she dropped the ball, she played more than a few games
Don't know which eyes to look into cos she's two faced
This wahala can only go one of two ways
Either we
Dream on or wake up
Break down or stay strong
Work through or break up
Part ways or make up
It was time to take off
We'd both been battered, it was time to stack the cake up
Baby I had to burn the bridge, but you struck the match
The smoke never cleared, you were puffed and passed
Told me you had baggage, I was like fuck the past
I felt lucky to have you, we need more than luck to last
Facts
(Oxlade)
Tell me what you want oh, because
I’ve been looking for you, two four seven
You steady tell me say you no dey, you no dey available oh
And I say anytime I see you I see double
Oh my girl I see double
So what’s it gonna cost to be your man?
To be everything you want oh
How far na, answer na
So what’s it gonna cost to be your man?
To be everything you want oh
Everything you call for
Oh, ah yeah
Tell me what you want oh, because
I’ve been looking for you, two four seven
You steady tell me say you no dey, you no dey available oh
And I say anytime I see you I see double
