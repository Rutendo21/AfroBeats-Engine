4AM Lyrics
Say you wanna roll, huh
You got that look in your eyes staring right into my soul, huh

Know how to light up the spot
Know how to put on a show now

Shey you no go leave me, don't leave me, aigh

But he was popped down, now you're laughing
And you're finished with that (Finish)
Uptown dinners 'n' that

True love hurts

People dey talk say na only woman I sabi talk about

Monster, dey boosting my adrenaline
Make you no expect me to act orderly
Brotherly make nobody come dey bother me
Brotherly make nobody come dey judge me
Nobody here holy pass Mary Magdalene
On top my money, you wan come dey shout for me
The one wey Buhari chop, how many he cut for me?
Make they play "Dorime," "Dorime" for the club for me, ha
People dey die, but people still dey go club that day

Ayo Girl (Fayahh Beat) Lyrics
You say I ain't shit, but you love that shit
Your friends send me pics; that's when you got pissed
But if she ain't a ten, I ain't touchin' it
I know why you're bitchin', I'm a dog with it
You know all my coupe's got no roof roof
You do it with no hands, call ya Bluetooth
Me and you was gang, you're my thug misses
The thing you got on, got 'em all singin'

Aye you girl in the tight up skirt
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them things?
Do you hear me callin' ya?
Do you hear me callin'?
Do you hear me callin'?
Who, baby girl? know I love ya
It'd be the reason many men want you
If hе wants the war I'd be die for you
But if I diе it means I'm gon' lose
Me every day, live life solo
Many girls don't do me, why you?
No, baby, only you, I know
And when they all know my name I fall

Aye you girl in the tight up skirt
Way that you move make my heart start to hurt
Aye you girl in the tight up shorts
You speed up ten more beats to my heart
Aye you girl in the jeans
How you fit them tings?
Do you hear me calling you?
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me callin'?

Girly, I don't mean to be rude
Girly, when they put me in the mood, oh baby
Yeah, the way they tight up me screw, oh na
And even you drive me crazy
Baby, I don't mean to be rude (Rude)
Make a rude boy go crazy, crazy (Crazy)

Bad Commando Lyrics
(London)

Bad man dem know
Dem know say I be bad commando
Each and every night on the road
I pray you never come near my zone
They no send me many years ago
When I day hustle for the street on a low
Each and every bad man dem know
They know say I be bad commando
Dem know, dam know
The boy done shut down the show
They no wan’ leave me alone
Dem know, huh
Bow down and pray for mercy
Whenever you come near me
Girl wanna try come test me
But she can never tempt me
She wanna buy me Bentley
She wanna indirectly
Try to dey complicate me
Therefore I show no mercy

Bad man dem know
Dem know say I be bad commando
Each and every night on the road
I pray you never come near my zone
They no send me many years ago
When I day hustle for the street on a low
Each and every bad man dem know

Boulevard Lyrics
Yuh
Bad girl she told me she don’t like me
She’s an animal she just wanna bite me
She don’t even wanna hear me she don’t text me
Yeah because I couldn’t afford a Nike
Other niggas they be trynna imitate me
Try to shoot at me but they can never take me
She be laughing at me cause I wore the same jeans
Undermining could’ve been my wifey
Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Yeah cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
And the dirty nigga took her to the cinema
Why you feeling her? why you kissing her?
I’m pissed off finna cause a holocaust
I’m pissed off finna cause a holocaust

I don’t need her, Monalisa
And I miss her, no picture
Hella pretty looking like a sunflower
Girl if I call you will you answer
Like Bruce Wayne like Bruce Wayne
Mehn i got the money, looking like am Bruce Wayne
Girl It’s too late girl it’s too late
Finna let you go like a lose chain

Bad girl she told me she don’t like me
She’s an animal she just wanna bite me
She don’t even wanna hear me she don’t text me
Yeah because I couldn’t afford a Nike
Other niggas they be tryna imitate me
They try they wanna take me
Huh wanna take me, no no way can’t take me

Dimension Lyrics
JAE5

When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey deh serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight
Man it's gettin' ugly, still I look for the beauty
Girls sellin' the coochie for the Gucci
All I see is good girls tryna show love
Same time all these groupies actin' bougie
I came in the game like, "Yo, excuse me"
Shout out my OG's and shout out my juvies
Get robbed for your carti, with the little Uzi
Bruddas shootin' clips like an action movie (On God)
And I know it seems stupid (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But bruddas ain't seen no love, they need cupid
Even though we're winnin', we still sinnin'
And this ain't gonna change overnight, it's deep-rooted (Oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Flashbacks of dead bodies and gunshots
Last time I see my brudda's face was a mugshot
PTSD will leave permanent scars
Can't lie, man, I ain't the same brudda that I once was (Oh, ooh-woah)

When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

I was taught to listen to my elders
I can hear the yutes cry, I'm feelin' so helpless
Open up my third eye, I'm feelin' so selfless
It's the same old story, different occasion
Nigerian, Ghanaian, Jamaican
Ugandan, Congolese and the Bajan
You can be a star or you can end up a patient
Gotta mind how you step, blood on the pavement

Bad man, don't threaten me
You no fit kill, who don die before
Oh, Father forgive me, my sins
I reminisce all the things I've done wrong
Oh, please put me under your wings
I still dey pray, make my mandem live long
'Cause many wan' quench the fire
Jah love gon' take us higher

When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come (Ooh-ooh)
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my brothers dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

Anytime I enter, call 911
Me I get the flow wey dey cause fire
Why they hate on me 'cause I'm rich and young
Watch me unchained while I watch you burn
No man can take my place
Forever and ever my music shining, ah-ha
That's what I got to say to y'all
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah3Embed

Divine Lyrics
(Sarz way)

Make nobody come against what me believe in
If you come against my vision you know that its treason
It's been a long time I had this feeling I was chosen
Situations that I came across made my heart frozen
Momma told me she was worried when I was in her belly
She said she had my brother and my sister okey-dokey
Then it took her four years before she even took in
Came a detox of blood that was a sign she was ready
She said I never kicked she said I never turned
She said I never caused her any discomfort
And she no dey at ease for like nine months
E be like say this pikin no wan gree comot
Say me I dey at peace I no even apply no force
And then she had a thought that maybe there might be a cause
Ou yeah she started worrying worryingabout a lot
She went to the hospital without noremorse
And then she met a doctor ( Doctor )
Tell me what is happening to my son ( My son)
Am I being attacked by a rival ( By a rival)
It's not making sense what do I do ( Then what she say)
She said doctor I'm not feeling fine
Tell me this could be a sign
And he said it is time she gave birth and named me Divine
Divine Divine

Nothing fit come against my destiny
I fight battles wey nobody ever see
As I dey this industry with God company
Me I go kaku so make everybody see
Script wey God mark you wan cancel it
English no correct make nobody bother me
You can laugh at me talk down on me God cover me
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye
My mama dey steady cast and binding
I give her joy every single time o
Na me dey make her dance like cocaina
As I dey grind every single time na she dey my mind
She dey send me prayers wey dey keep me tight
I pity anybody wey follow me fight ( Follow me fight)
Ou yes I felt pain when I lost my Father
Ou yes I felt pain when I lost my brother
Ou yes I felt weight stacking on my shoulder
Omo it kept growing as I got older
The voice in my head told me i'm a soldier
Then I remember the time mama named me Divine

I grab the sea bass with the chopsticks and hit it with the lime (One time)
Ain't no askin' about my lady, you can bet that she's fine (Fine)
Body like the fourty-two and she gets better with time, yeah (Boo-boo)
The Maybach leather came in elephant's breath
These kind of colours you don't know unless your earnings are blessed (Bling-blow)
Threw some shots of opposition not for war just a test (Uh)
Intoxicated by revenge, this heat is burning his chest (Cling, cling)
I got this suit in navy blue, but chose the burgundy breast
AP fresh, my watch collection murder the rest (Bling-blow)
You're hearin' lies, if you ain't heard, I'm the best
Me and Rema got the remedy to purge you the stress, uh
Ain't nobody fly like me, uh-huh
Spendin' on expensive shit, uh-huh
Neck and my wrist icy, uh-huh
Small boy, but I mighty, uh-huh
Ain't nobody fly like me, uh-huh
Spendin' on expensive shit, uh-huh
Neck and my wrist icy, uh-huh
Them never see this kind thing

Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a Bimmer
Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a Bimmer
Fresh young nigga puffin' on a cigar
Fresh young nigga puffin' on a cigar
Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a Bimmer
Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a Bimmer

How you gonna tell me that it's never gonna work now?
Type of shit to make me put a verse down
Worse now 'cah we made our bed and gotta lay in it
Thought it wasn't hard for me, but every day it is
Heartbreak's such a dark place, but we stay in it
What I'm sayin' is exactly what I say it is, I found you
I feel your presence when I'm not around you
Queen in your city, they need to crown you
Holy water, baby, let me drown you
Fire and water, I gotta 'low you
Burn out then reappear
Light still guidin' you home, you know I'm there
And rest assured if you ever needed help
Or just need a place to hide, know I'll keep it to myself, word

Oh, girl, you're shinin'

Slow down, down
This my girl, very rough
This love I never see before
Body vibrate when she give me touch
She say I'm gifted, very gifted
She say na only me fit reach her deep end
She say na only me dey make her head swell
She dey thank Jah for my existence
Close down
Can't you see the sign? Close down
Ain't no other girl is allowed
If you play silly games, it's a foul
She my girlfriend, not my partner
Na she I go carry meet my mama
Girly don't snitch, shе's a gangster
She's a type of girl who wеy no dey for banta

First date, she no dey to order
Ask for the bill, she bring her card out
Even if money no dey for her account
She still try, she still buga the matter
She no get big yansh, she no get big breast
She no dey even try to dey impress
Na only true love be her interest
I go take her matter serious like project

Oh, baby, hold me, oh, baby, hold me

You know that I only wanna taste
Got me in shock like a tase
Oh, baby, hold me, oh, baby, hold me
And we gon' shine together just like a Rollie

Don’t let me take you back to your mama
Twenty missed calls 'cause I’m not home
What you gonna do, only God knows

Jealousy you put on me

Jealousy you put on me
That's why your mind's out, mind’s out, why? (Fuck it)
Jealousy you put on me

Why you wanna make me make believe

And it got too deep girl, too deep
It's a problem
Fell for you straight to the bottom
People ask what happened, I go silent
I wouldn't even speak on you
But now you wanna mention me

Now you wanna mention me

Now you wanna mention me
Mention me like you’re bored of me

Pantera Lyrics

Ey, ey
Me concentro, es mi momento
No voy a permitir que ganen, lo siento
No voy a ser el perdedor de su cuento
No voy a ser uno más de los míos muerto
Vamos a verlo pa' ver si es cierto (Ey, ey)
Que nadas en el mar abierto (Oh, ey)
O caminas en el desierto (Oh, guacha)
Cada vez estoy más despierto (Ey, ey, oh)
Saco la garra y siempre lucho como pantera
Te dejamos еn los hueso' como calavera
Todos los días a prueba, yo nunca lе echo la hueva
Defiendo lo que me queda, vencerme no creo que puedan
Oh, varios me juzgan de maléfico
Oh, solo porque soy de México
Oh, no saben que mi pueblo es mágico
Varios quieren lo mío porque es épico
Me buscan hasta con mapa, algunos llegan y tratan
Solo mi furia desatan, voy a botarles la tapa
Porque aquí nada es de grapa, puedes llamar a tu papá
Que de esta madre te saca, tu corazón en estaca

La maldad quiere atrapar mi alma
Pero no se quedarán con nada
No podrán, no podrán
Nunca vencerán a mi raza (Gang, gang, gang)
Gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang

Roadside (+234 Remix) Lyrics
No fit buy love with Ferragamo
You no fit buy love with Ferrari, oh
Be man no be by jalabia, oh
Shey you dey talk all your own
You no talk wetin I do for you
Girl, I will do better (Oh na)
You raise the bar so high, but I will do better (Oh na)
I shy away when you school me like a school teacher
I'll take my chance when I know, say I don't get Visa
That you left me, left me, left me on the roadside (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
When you kept me waitin' on you all night
I never knew you'd be a heartbreaker (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
I'm done with your fake love (Your fake love)
You left me, left without a goodbye (Ooh, girl, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
But I really thought you was a good guy
I should've known you was a heartbreaker (Ooh, girl, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
I'm done with your fake love (I'm done with your fake)
Love, love, love, love

Baby, you, you indescribable
You indefinable, oh, my God
Baby, you, you unreliable
Unjustifiable in the things you do
I introduced you to my brothers
And you came 'round for dinner with my mother
Yes, you, you still went and did a runner
Guess you showed your true colours
So it's too, too bad
What a shame I never saw you like that
Didn't see it comin', but it happened real fast
Too bad, too bad

That you left me, left me, left me on the roadside
When you kept me waitin' on you all night
I never knew you'd be a heartbreaker (Heartbreaker)
I'm done with your fake love (Your fake love)
You left me, left without a goodbye
And I really thought you was a good guy
I should've known you was a heartbreaker (Heartbreaker)
I'm done with your fake love (I'm done with your fake)
Love (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
Love, love, love (Da-da, da-da, da-da)

Sad Girls Lyrics
Sad girls
Sad girl, I promise, you'll be okay
(Another banger)

Money on my mind, guess you fantasize
Levels to the remedy stuck in my mind
Told my momma, "Shit, I promise we gon' be alright"
Still, I keep you awake at night
Yeah, get it in, only way I'll get it out
At least I made my brother proud
I be riding 'round, they tryna find me now
I'm feelin' happy, I ain't always down, yeah
I know she feelin' me, I'm not a dealer, B, I'm the realest G
I know LSD's how I feel the breeze
I got the sad girls feeling like I'm ecstasy
I got this one girl telling me that I'm the one
Came close, had to pull it when I jam my gun
Got more time when they feel the drums
Got the bass on my mind when I'm feelin' numb
Come on, little darling, we gon' fly to the sky
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head goes dumb
Yeah, I'm walkin' on clouds, is it real?
I be trippin' with a baddie when I'm standin' 'round
'Cause I like her but this girl a Gemini
And she, and she really got me trapped right now
Are you feelin' the vibes, is it real?
I can't hear you when the music be up so

(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl)
Promise you'll be okay

There's something I see about this girl, different
From the first time I saw her
For a moment, she looked like a loner
When she move on the dance floor
She got the vibe, she got that essence where nobody else fi belong
I can tell she a sad girl, love sad boy, this side she be on
You might also like
Oh, party's over
She cryin' outside
I asked her, "What's wrong?"
She said, "Leave me alone
I don't want your love
Kiss me and just go"
I think she's happy she's a sad girl

Come on, little darling, we gon' fly to the sky (Oh)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head goes dumb
Yeah, I'm walkin' on clouds, is it real? (Oh)
I be trippin' with a baddie when I'm standin' 'round
'Cause I like her but this girl a Gemini (Oh)
And she, and she really got me trapped right now
Are you feelin' the vibes, is it real? (Are you real?)
I can't hear you when the music be up so

(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay)
I'll be drinking 'til the feeling in my head
(Promise you'll be, I promise you'll be okay, sad girl, promise you'll be okay)
And I feel like I'm floatin' through the sky
Baby, tell me if you feel what I feel
I'm imaginin' us smokin', feelin' high
Got this Cali in my pack for the chill
She told me come and fly to this paradise
I got feelings in my body and they never lie
All this liquor in my cup's got me feelin' right
I don't care about my issues when I feel alive, yeahEmbed

When we want to the party
Bring like twenty baddies
When we show the place
New designers, we be steady shinin'
Everything I get, omo na God grace

Oluwa egba mi
Koma wole, kope wole
Egba mi
Make my blessing no seize (Yes)
Kope wole (Yeah, uh), a sha ti de
Egba mi
They underrated me
That thing they say to me
Rap no sell 'til them start to pay money
Now they come back with a track to play for me
To get me on that, need an application fee
This track was made for me
Pastor pray for me
'Cause me I no know where this high has taken me
You for like park on the chart no vacancy
We want it all now fuck waitin' patiently

Step in'a the room and the energy wey me carry enter, olewu
Sabi never lose you know when I dish am them go chop am, belleful
Otilo, it's far gone
Them no fit to fathom
Nothing close to random
No dey beg your pardon
Eh, eh, eh
To the left, to the right, dribble them like e Messi
Eh, eh, eh
All your girls and your boys them dey crush on my body
Eh, eh, eh
And I move with God, so victory is certain
Eh, eh, eh
They got nothing on me

Won da mo (Won da mo)
Atin lo (Atin lo)
O tin lor (O tin lor)
O tin lor (Otin lor), mhm-oh
Owo nlo (Owo nlo)

Oluwa egba mi
Koma wole, kope wole
Egba mi
Make my blessing no seize
Kope wole, a sha ti de

I'm on the leadin' side
My people sure me die
Family for life (And keep my guys for life)
And nobody can dim our shine
We win till the end of time
Laho wowo

Won Le Le Lyrics
You know I don't even blame you
You didn't notice us
We started to shine
Yeah

They didn't notice 'til the moment I started to glow
Now pretty ladies drop it lower than konko below
Is that the reason that I carry my shoulders so high?
I guess it's just the arrogance starting to show (Trust me)
Now it's all about the commas when I'm speaking grammar (Woah)
Balenciaga bag under the Agbada (Yeah)
Remember when we couldn't even break bread? (Break bread)
Now I'm sitting at the table observing my manners
Chop bag, clean mouth, everybody code
Pull-up backstage, every groupie no be hoe
Funny when you blow you be everybody bro (I swear)
At least I got lifelines to show
Make no man come pour sand, sand for my garri
Me I dey grind nonstop
Me no wan hear if it's not 'bout the money, ah
As I dey run my run
Make no man come pour sand, sand for my garri, ah
Me I dey grind nonstop
Me no wan hear if it's not 'bout the money, ah
As I dey run my run

Singing word for word to my music they call jargon

Went from jumping danfo in Isolo to a wagon
