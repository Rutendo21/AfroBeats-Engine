Abobi Lyrics
It's Kel-P vibes

Rumuokoro don catch fire
Last night I was walking on the road
When they shoot the man and shoot him tyre
Ikorodu don catch fire
As I dey waka, I dey see one man wen be say dem shoot wey dey carry kaya
The Baba carry kaya
Soldier go, solider come
Barrack no dey run
Kill by a gun, you will die by a gun
How you go feel at the point of no return?
‘Nuff men dead under the sun
Na so them kill the innocent man
Innocent man get paddy man
Paddy man vex turn Taliban
Taliban run the whole town down
Dem don kill Abobi eh (Don kill Abobi)
Na who kill Abobi? (Who kill Abobi?)
Abobi, Abobi eh
Dem don kill Abobi (Don kill Abobi)

You hurting her feelings
You got to love

Maybe you get her dinner
Open the door Kiss her like a winner

Better make her relax
Ah Eeeh
Tell her no lies
Better tell her no lies X2

Mwanamke sio bajaji

Verse 2(Patoranking)
Nobody run to me
If you no treat your woman well n she tell u good bye
That u claim say you bad and you claim say u hard
Another man a take her to dubai
Good girl dem scarce in a we nation
When u get a good one don't ask questions
Better take her for vacation
Before she put you on probation
If you get a good match hide her
Never treat her like a
Teach her how to dance some amakayda
And always make sure you stand beside her
(Aika)
If you get a good match hide her
Never treat her like she's a kawaida

Black LyricsI just had a word with my forefathers
They said this would hit you hard like firecrackers
Black truth, coming from a black root
We have to go back to black, we have to put black on track
Wahyahsay
Black sold black, black scold black
Too many lies, black told black
Moving forward in life, black hold back
Black hates black, black don't rate black
Black underrates black, even some black don’t wanna see some black people dey black
Black beat black, black hit black
Black cheats black, black maltreats black
Black kill black (yes), black don't feel black
When black give black, black want to steal back
Black don't support black, black extort black
Black deports black, black reports black
Black snitch black, black bewitch black
Black don’t enrich black, good will, black never wish black
Black don't appreciate black, black never tolerates black
Black relegates black, that's why black currencies depreciate back
Black deceive black, black don't believe black
Black religion, black division
Lies they feed on, blocks the vision
Me do this for the next generation of black
Let my music be the truth and penetration for black
Love is the answer to the elevation of black
This new mentality, we need a new motivation for black
Black leaders you don't need to to have a bad mind
You travel abroad, you see good roads and airport, you come back and act blind
Clean water, good food, we can't find
Blackness, black richness, black excellence, black love
And black mind, that's what we want
No no no no, no love, no love
No love, no love
No no no no, no love, no love
No love, no love
No no no no, no love, no love
No love, no love
No no no no, no love, no love
No love, no love
Freedom, freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)
Freedom, freedom
All I want is freedom, freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)
Freedom, freedom huh
Black hating black is the reason why the growth is taunt
If I don't love you as my brother, what else do I want
Every black must have each other’s back if they wanna be in front
Now let’s rewrite the black love in a bold font
That's what we want, one love

Clean And Pure Lyrics

Clean and pure

Chale what be this, Ewurade bɛ yɛ me show
Ignorance is bliss but I think I'm in the know
Ei ei Joe, every time we touch road
We get eyes on the globe, no be one man show
Steady worki worki while the waste man browsing
Gets fishy fishy but we one man thousand
Thomas want doubt? Okay allow him
Learnt how to do, now some say why him?
Lips never talk but the eyes saw
Steady on this journey, real and raw
Through this art of course we endurе
Still my heart so clean and pure
No gеt time for petty petty, M.anifesty wo yɛ more
Detty detty detty detty detty road but we clean and pure
I don't wanna be the person
Wey go mek you dey para oh
No be me hold your blessing
I no like wahala oh
My heart is clean, clean and pure
Clean, clean and pure
My heart is clean, clean and pure
Clean, clean and pure

High spirit so they can't kill it
God's plan no man fit to cancel it (No, never)
E no be me I'm just a conduit
My destiny I was born to it (Born to do it chale)
In any endeavor my breda my breda
Pilgrimage to the top no be one man in Mecca
Since Adam and Eve, Emefa and Emeka
Obi wo bi sin woa doesn't really make you a beggar
Me nya wayɛ not my interest
Clean and pure kinda rare but a big flex (Big flex)
Bad energy be useless
I'm taking off from Madina to the universe

I don't wanna be the person
Wey go mek you dey para oh
No be me hold your blessing
I no like wahala oh

Enemies LyricsYou know Jude
Hmm, oh my God
That guy is just something else
He's so jealous of his brother
He's so jealous
Like he's envious
He's talking ill of them
He's not even happy for their success
He's so jealous and so bitter
Obviously because he hasn't been getting shows
You know, he's jus there
It's almost like he's fallen off the surface of the industry, you know
And he doesn't hide it at all
You know Jude and I are very close
We're very very close
Oh I don't know if I'll make it back

Be careful who you carry to your mother…your brother

In every 12, there's one Judas
For every tupac, you got shooters
True that
For every Ceasar, there's one Brutus
Wherever food at, you got looters
Tell me who that
Cos they want your breakfast, they want your lunch
They want your pictures, they want to munch
If you speaking, check in their phone

Open my eyes to things that I've been blind to
Hold me close
Take me to places I've never been...

You can get anything wey you want (anything)

If I Get Money Ehn (Remix) LyricsAs i get money ehn, i con start to enjoy
I open my company, all my village people na im i employ
Everybody wey know me before come dey call me oga bomboy
I marry my girlfriend e no reach two weeks na im she born boy
As i get money ehn, i sign big footballers
I sign mikel obi i no ask am how much, i paid him in dollars
There is nothing money cannot do, i make messi goalkeeper for gunners
If i write exam i no dey bother again, i dont care if i come last
As i get money ehn, i call my landlord
I tеll am to tell me the cost of his propеrty just in one word
My brother pato
As i get my own money i begin to diet
I want to become the next metusela am not ready to die yet
A hundred and fifty years is not too much and thats my target
Raba dey! Raba raba dey
Raba dey! Raba raba dey
Raba dey (Money dey oh)
Raba raba dey
Raba dey! Raba raba dey
Raba dey (Money dey oh)
Raba raba dey

As i get money ehn, i start to import
All the ugly girls wey dey lekki phase1 i start to export
Dangote follow me for instagram as him hear say i dey hot
Otedola con dey para say him must carry me go court
As i get money eh, i enter monaco
I carry my three igbo wives Nkechi,Chinye Adaku
Mun kote mai masala dukan ku kutan gidan na mukaku
Na so so EFCC everyday na me dem begin dey tackle
As i get money ehn, i go do meeting with nepa

Nice Idea patoranking my brother the approach is clever
Like rich monk i dey dash my money on a daily to whoever

Inconsiderate Lyrics
Man a shout and whisper she nah respond,
And I wish we were together but nothin' a go run,
Man a shout and whisper she nah respond,
Wrapped me round her likkle finger like a wristband,
But you never say you love me babe but still I stick around,
An' you got me like a barber draggin' me around the town,
When I treat you like a beauty queen you treat me like a clown,
And I think you like to do it jus' for fun,
You're inconsiderate,
Inconsiderate about my love,
And it's deliberate,
What you're doing to my aching heart,
And  know,
Yeah he knows,
I'm shot by you,
If you want a shy guy tell me I can be it,
If you want a rude boy baby I can deal it,
If you want another man trust me you ah go feel it,
If you have no other blood let me be the reason,

You left about a week ago,
Yuh told me that yuh goin' on the Chicago,
Because yuh dread girl me wanna let yuh know,
Girl I'm gone I'm done I'm gone,

You're inconsiderate,
Inconsiderate about my love,
And it's deliberate,
What you're doing to my aching heart,
And  know,
Yeah he knows,
I'm shot by you,
You're inconsiderate,
Inconsiderate about my love,
And it's immediate,
To seek attention for my broken heart,
And  know,
Yeah he knows,
I'm shot by you,
Every mans dream is to mek every galfren' right,
How come yuh fall off? Ego and pride,
Better watch yuhself now cah the  no hide,
Cah the lovin' and the touch yuh a give me put aside,
Yuh claim seh yuh luv me buh yuh date anotha' man,
Me hav' a feelin' seh yuh gotta betta' plan,
Yuh choose to let me car and ride pon a van,
Nex' time wen me see yuh gal I treat yuh like a fan,

You're inconsiderate,
Inconsiderate about my love,
And it's deliberate,
What you're doing to my aching heart,
And  know,
Yeah he knows,
I'm shot by you,
You're inconsiderate,
Inconsiderate about my love,
And it's immediate,
To seek attention for my broken heart,
And  know,

No toilet and no gutter
Things are getting hotter

Particula Lyrics
They told me everybody's 15 minutes in a different timezone
And since I have it at the moment, you the one I wanna shine my light on
Get your life, get your life, little mama, won't you get your life on?
Ain't nothing cooler than the wrong moves, when you do 'em to the right song, the right song
Let's shoot this movie and put the shit on repeat
I hope this Mary's not making you fall asleep
Before we hit the road, put our phones on silent
Nobody's tryna bring sand to the beach
What would it take to change your plans for the weekend?
'Cause I am tryna kick it like EA
The whole thing, the pre-party, the pre-sex
Now we hit the Major League where the G's at
I like you, girl, in particula

Heavenly father we thank you
We thank you for today
We thank you for tomorrow
We thank you for the gift of life
We thank you for giving blessing to our lives
Thank you for blessing us
We shall be the head and not dead
No evil against us shall prosper
Who it hurts success and victory is our passion
Sickness is far away from us
Houses cars money long life and prosperity
Is a passion in Jesus name Amen
Thank you mama, rise up
In a society where all the secret one came
The secret one came
Put them beats on it

But a all a we money you use to by gun

Uhnuh draw the sheet and make the whole place stink
Yo nuh peep pon dutty blob inna drink

Rudi Lyrics"Rudi" - Rich Mavoko ft Patoranking
Sauti na tabasamu lako
Ndio linafanya nikukumbuke
Kinachoniumiza mwenzako
Unapolia chozi nsifute
Mapenzi sidhani mimi
Kilichobaki ni uadui
Kuniona hautamani kwanini?
Kweli maziwa nimegeuka tui
Nami nina moyo
Yapita miaka mingi sijakuona
Nami nina moyo mama
Upate siku moja uje niona
Nami nina moyo
Yapita miaka mingi sijakuona
Nami nina moyo mama
Ungalisema neno moja ningepona
Mwenzako sura yangu (Nitaiweka wapi?)
Ooh sura yangu (Nitaiweka wapi?)
Ama Moyo wangu me (Nitauweka wapi?)

Sickness Sickness  Sickness small me
Well me yes, you are dumping me
In this wicked World
Baby every one needs a company
My heart bleeds
For your Love
Girl i bleed for your love
Me, Me can imagine
If u know dey me, what a sad ting (aaaaaeeeeeh)
I cant imagine
You inna me life girl what a sad ting
Nikiwa nawe mwenzako ndo napona
Na nikilala usiku ndotoni nakuona
Ukipata mafua me napa ka homa
I wanna be your Lover, your friend and your owner

All my boys dem crazy, dem no normal
Shoe for my legs, Balenciaga
Something by my waist, na revolver
Sweet kin love, sweet pass piña colada
I've been preeein' from the corner
Wetin be your name? You say, "Suzanna"
Old school like nuvo, old school like ferra
Call me afunki with all this raba, yeah (JAE5)

Feeling like ah president
Every time you come my way
Pretty and intelligent
Mi nuh care what them say
Queen ah mi residence

Oh, my lover

I'ma buy you a drink, have you thinking I'm T-Pain
I fell in love with a stripper on a weekday
Bro's a F baby, so I call him Weezy
Need a milli in accounts then I'm easy
Shawty on E, so I got her feelin' gassed up
If she's too gassed that ain't really a me thang
It's a confidence, baby girl, I ain't arrogant
I don't even know why you got an attitude

Suzanna go make I bus gun (Oh)
Suzanna go make I dey rob (Oh, oh)
Suzanna go make I dey court (Oh)

After round one, she can't wait for the round two
Baby, come 'round, show me what that tongue do
Broski fresh home, so bring a friend too
Bro don't trust hoes, so he brought a skeng too
VVS looking like I won the lotto
In a G-Wagon, I don't mind potholes
Baby, when I come yours, no photo
No excuse, bro made it out zongo
Making money this year and next year
Still praying bro comes fresh home this year
She only loves me 'cause I bought her a necklace
The love for the money makes you reckless
So we sold out every show, there's no end to the queue
Remember when we used to go halves on a Q?
In the hood I seen a lot now my eyes full
Said she wanna eat brunch near the Eiffel

Feeling like ah president

Get inna mi cothes and mi shoes very quickly
Errbody know mi sawg is 360

Wonder Lyrics
Ahn ahn
Ahhahhahhahh
I still dey wonder
Ahn ahn
Ahhahhahhahh
I still dey wonder

So many things to talk about
Wonder why people get attention when they die
Wonder why Stevie no dey see
Wonder why people gaz dey struggle to survive
Wonder why people be picking war over peace
Wonder why people no fit love David and Wiz
Wonder why guys judge a lady by physique
And I wonder why ladies judge a nigga by his whip
Wonder why you wanna bring another brother down
All because you and a blogger wan trend
Wonder why there are seven wonders in the universe
But I still wonder why wonders shall never end
And I still wonder why sometimes I cannot blend
Still wonder why enemies pretend to be your friends
Wonder why time is long and life is short
And I wonder why I never buy Ferrari yet
(Ayaya)
Ahn ahn
Ahhahhahhahh

Tell the people we are ready
We bad and ready
No go act shady
Give them on a daily
Tell the people we are ready
We bad and ready
No go act shady
Give them on a daily

I dey think if some people sef dey wonder
I dey wonder if some people sef dey think
For this world ,the good ones die younger
But the wicked ones are still breathing
No be by wetin you deserve na by wetin you believe
So I dey wonder why words make you bleed
You don ever wonder why I no too get fans for Portugal
Is because I cannot rap in Portuguese
Make una wonder with me
Why we getting killed by the police
Why is there low job opportunities
When emergency dey we no fit call the paramedic
Still wonder wetin happen to Chime salt and Olu billie
Wonder why a teenager go spend him school fees
Wonder why you gotta be a rat cause of the cheese
Wonder why person go steal my 30BG piece
You a piece of shit ya bish
If the shoe fits
