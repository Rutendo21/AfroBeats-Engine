Cast (Gen Z Anthem) Lyrics
Life is not problematical, we make it problematical because we are all listening to someone else to something without listening to ourselves. We clutter up our lives with insignificant things that have no value

Open your life
Open your canter sip from your bottle and vibe
No dey dull my guy
Or e go pass you by
Open your eyes
They don't care about you
And when you die
They will cry but live like you weren't alive
If they get gun they go kill you
Say your money or life
Abi you wan kpai
I know my blessings no go pass me by
'Cause I am gonna live my life
Trust me I gonna live my life
If I cast then I cast, yeah
Anything wey won sup go sup
I come this life all alone, yeah
Anything they wan talk, they talk
If I cast then I cast, yeah
Anything wey won sup go sup
I come this life all alone, yeah
Anything they wan talk, they talk
I come this life all alone, yeah

I'm gonna be who I want to be
Live my life the way I wanna live
With no shame, with no haste
Suck on these nuts if you ain't approve of
I've cared for too long
I heard life has no limitations but the one you make

If I cast then I cast, yeah
Anything wey won sup go sup
I come this life all alone, yeah
Anything they wan talk, they talk
If I cast then I cast, yeah
Anything wey won sup go sup

DITR Lyrics
Noticed the stars in the sky were lost
No its not me it’s just the place I was born
I thought this world was sane enough
It’s hard being the D I T R

I disobeyed
I taught you better
My mama yelled
Omomi wa da
Your child is changing
She started drinking
She’s doing drugs now
To end this feelings
She don dey do runs girl
She’s a bit shy God have mercy
Smoke a little Indian hem
Or se igbo labi
She’s still your baby
Nothing has changed please
She’s only aging
Peer pressure bad ni

Loving ties
Scary fight
All we know is loving people wе don’t like
Just to vibe
Then wе end up drinking liquor
In the night
With a smile
Claiming that we satisfied
With all this fights
Punches everywhere
Like it's Christmas light

I disobeyed
I taught you better
My mama yelled
Omomi wa da
Your boy is changing
He started drinking
He’s doing drugs now
To end this feelings

He’s a diamond in the rough
Now he’s just playing with a gun
Does he go to school anymore
Or is he the king of his cult

'Cause I disobeyed
I thought you better

Your child is changing
They started drinking
He’s doing drugs now
To end this feelings

London
You know, know
Yea

My denim faded, but I rock it like a baby in a cot
I put the water in the ocean in the city that I'm from
I light the room in the dark 'cause my bling is a torch
I watched fashion die today in the mirror that I saw
Ahhah
Shebi na go ball, we go ball
Flex to the dawn
I go settle the funds
No return
I'm gonna enter the club
Know dey might front
'Cause me I get the gun me
No dey do me wrong

Oh, I'm a fashion killa, yeah
I got much to live out, yeah
When I pass, you shiver, yeah
And my ass got thicker, yeah
I'm a fashion killa, yeah
I got much to live by, yeah
When I pass, you shiver
And my ass got thicker

Image
Picture a chandelier on my head
I see the diamonds wet everywhere
I know you see me drenched in finesse
In finesse
Oh, reason
Think of it, a brown shirt and blue ribbon
Diamonds awaken every time I need it
Babushka on everything, my allegiance
My allegiance

Two steps into the water

Six feet deep and I'm under
Oh, I felt higher, higher, higher, higher

Why did I get myself into this mess?
'Cause I'm drowning

Two more steps and I'm on the ground
Three more times, then I held you right with me

​in the light Lyrics
London

Don't teach me how, how to love you no more
I will figure it out by myself
Don't show me love (Don't show me love)
I want to see what you're hiding, come in the light
Come in the light

Tell me, lady, don't lie
What is on your mind?
What's beneath the makeup?
Show me what you're made of
I'm willing to show mine
If you don't mind
I'll love you as you are, girl
But you don't pick up my calls
Every time busy, tell me what's up
Calling since morning, baby, no word, oh
Thought we had a discussion
Don't teach me how, how to love you no more
I will figure it out by myself
Don't show me love (Don't show mе love)
I want to see what you're hiding, come in thе light
Come in the light
Come in the light

Who no know me know me now
I'm a baddie with a broken heart
My trust issues gotten the best of me
I know you want me 'cause I bring the fire
Fire in the jungle, light you when I want to
Make you fall in love
Je suis une menteuse
Lied that I don't want you
Let me be the one to
Make you fall in love with me

You don't teach me how, how to love you no more

Need You Lyrics
Beautiful, huh
No doubt and I suppose
I need your love enough, it's cold (Know ya want me)
Oh, what if I get it wrong?
Effort for you, I can't help
Fallin' for you was a part of my plan
You couldn't understand, no
I call your phone, I hang up
Fallin' for you was a part of my plan
(Oh, baby, oh, baby)
I can't explain it, I don't mean to roll your dice
All this light not ours, it's mine
I can't even see, it's clear, then find the perfect sex
Girl, you make it hard to hide
Hide that I need you, baby
(Hide that I need you, baby)
Hide that I need you, baby

I heard the news 'bout the guy you're datin'
You see my new girl, she's fire, baby
And you don't care much and I ain't hatin'
You said you need time, but I ain't waitin'
The ball's in your court, aight, I fall short
Said we'd be friends, it's all talk
I know all your flaws, I know your four walls
You know my—, mmm-mmm 'cause barely saw yours
I'm bеin' silly, but you know that I had you for life
I get you any bag you like, comе on, it's light
Hopin' that that your bumpin' in to me when you're plannin' your night
I'm just glad you're alright
Mad how I move when you chat to me rude
When we shoutin' on the phone, I come back, sellin' food
But the catch twenty-two is that I'm a catch too
You could never be my opp, but if I ever catch you, girl, it's—

I can't explain it, I don't mean to roll your dice
All this light not ours, it's mine
I can't even see, it's clear, then find the perfect sex
Girl, you make it hard to hide
Hide that I need you, baby
(Hide that I need you, baby)
Hide that I need you, baby (Hide that I need you, baby)

Need you, babeEmbed

Oh-oh-oh-oh

From Bamenda, it's Libianca
Oh-oh (A-yo, Mage, it's yo' beat)

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now, did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now, did you notice me? (Did you notice me now?)
In bed but my mind stay wondering
Overthinking but I'd rather be sleeping
Grab a drink, I need escape now
Two four seven, I be in the state now
But I can no longer depend on it
I become my own worst enemy
I don dey question my own sanity
Waiting to be saved
But I'd rather be alone than to have fake friend to check on me
Don't let them get to me
I'm just tired, not tryna be lazy
'Cause I've got a lot that I've been dealing with
I know you understand
I know you understand

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now, did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now, did you notice me?

Oh, holy father

Oh, don't let go
Nine to five, nine to five bebe

Time to time, dey check on me bebe
Once a while
'Cause I've been drinking more alcohol
So I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm always by myself
I don't really need your help
Yes I smoke weed, I can't find peace
I stay hungry, don't need munchies

Roadside (+234 Remix) Lyrics
No fit buy love with Ferragamo
You no fit buy love with Ferrari, oh
Be man no be by jalabia, oh
Shey you dey talk all your own
You no talk wetin I do for you
Girl, I will do better (Oh na)
You raise the bar so high, but I will do better (Oh na)
I shy away when you school me like a school teacher
I'll take my chance when I know, say I don't get Visa
That you left me, left me, left me on the roadside (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
When you kept me waitin' on you all night
I never knew you'd be a heartbreaker (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
I'm done with your fake love (Your fake love)
You left me, left without a goodbye (Ooh, girl, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
But I really thought you was a good guy
I should've known you was a heartbreaker (Ooh, girl, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
I'm done with your fake love (I'm done with your fake)
Love, love, love, love

Baby, you, you indescribable
You indefinable, oh, my God
Baby, you, you unreliable
Unjustifiable in the things you do
I introduced you to my brothers
And you came 'round for dinner with my mother
Yes, you, you still went and did a runner
Guess you showed your true colours
So it's too, too bad
What a shame I never saw you like that
Didn't see it comin', but it happened real fast
Too bad, too bad

That you left me, left me, left me on the roadside
When you kept me waitin' on you all night
I never knew you'd be a heartbreaker (Heartbreaker)
I'm done with your fake love (Your fake love)
You left me, left without a goodbye
And I really thought you was a good guy
I should've known you was a heartbreaker (Heartbreaker)

No pull me back the other way

Yeah, I might be playing games
But I've been hurt before
I don't want to get my heart broken

Seen a challenge, so you want more
But me I can't give you anything 'cause

Hope you don't come running

But na only to your song I go ever listen even if e cause issue, darling

I'm, I'm gonna be here by your side
When you wake we'll play outside
Don't be scared I'm only right
Baby, let it flow through you
You're the reason for this blues
I'm here to get you through
Baby, let it flow through you
Baby, let it flow through you
You're the reason for this blues
I'll be here by your side
When you wake we'll play outside
Baby, let it flow through you
Lеt it flow through you
Let it flow through you

Stuck on You (with Ayra Starr, DAP The Contract & LMBSKN) Lyrics
Can't get my mind off you


All I got, you're the one I really want
But the day's so cold, can't be alone oh, oh, oh
Give me love, wey dey make my head dey turn
You're the one I really want, you're the one oh, oh
I'm stuck on you, you, you, you, you
Can't get my mind off (Off) you, you (Do, do), you, you, you (Do, do)
Tell me what you wanna do, do, do, do, do (Do, do, do, do)
Can't get my mind off (You)
Can't get my mind off (You)
Can't get my mind off

Yeah
Tell me what you wanna do mama
I'm with whatever, we can do it, it's cool mama (Yeah)
The way you squeeze in them jeans, you could juice mama
Don't gotta tell you, do nothin'
Hit splosh mama, poof
Tell the truth (Yeah)
It's too many feins feedin' on you, nothing new (No)
But you can have it all, you're lookin' at the proofs
See I talk how I walk, I'm the man on the move
We can talk about
See I'm a sinner but I pray and the Lord knows
A real killer recognizes a real killer
And you got what I need, ain't got to talk about it
And they don't 
Can't nobody do it better, deader
They say never say, "Never", 'cause they can never
But I never see nobody like you, I remember
I want this forever, and ever, ever

Toxic Lyrics
(Why did you make me to do it?)
(Why did you force me to take it?)

Why did you make me to do it?
Why did you make me to lose it?
Why did you give me the drugs that I took?
Why did you force me to take it?
I thought that what we had was love, was love
I gave you all I had, not much, not much
Things you gave to me were worse, were worse
And I'll apologize no more, no more
But I'm sorry
That I loved somebody that would hurt me
In the past that's sad but truthfully
I died when you left, when you left me
Oh, sadly
Oh, sadly
I've been crying my еyes out with Xanny
I've been drowning my sorrows in a bottle
I'vе been smoking very much since you left me, oh

Why did you make me to lean?
Pop a Molly in a cup and sip
I thought you'd never ever let me be
I thought you'd hold me down 'til I get clean
I thought that what we had was love, was love
I gave you all I had, not much, not much
Things you gave to me were worse, were worse
And I'll apologize no more, no more

But I'm sorry
That I loved somebody that would hurt me
In the past that's sad but truthfully
I died when you left, when you left me
Oh, sadly
Oh, sadly
I was crying my eyes out with Xanny
I've been drowning my sorrows in a bottle
I've been smoking very much since you left me

Oh, woah-oh, uh-huh (Since you left me)
Since you left me (Since you left)

Won Da Mo Lyrics

Mavins

Wake up in the morning, hallelujah
Chasin' the money
Chasin' the bag
No lookin' back
Me and my gang
Steady fire we leave no gap
Gucci, Gucci, Louis V
Mix my Monster with Hennessy
My eye don dirty, I no fit see
The smell of doings shall lead me
Baby girl, why you cryin'?
Clean your tears with my currency
Bullion van outside the club
Who tell you say we need protection?
Hop in my all black challenger
All road leadin' to the dynasty
We know ourself and they know we
Hm, they know we
