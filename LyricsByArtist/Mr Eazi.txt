I wanna go all night
Go all night for you, for you, for you

One magnum, I've got the stamina
Whole team bad and I'm the manager

Show me you've got moves for my camera
Ba-back it, get your best side (Yeah)
Pretty little babe from the West side (West side)
I'm the reason why you don't fuck with next guys (Next guys)
When I needed TLC, you never left I (Left I)
Hands on your waist, slow wind
Back it up for me, go time

Freaky girl, how your ting so good?
So tight you can't tek no wood
Leave your ex-man, he ain't no good

I come alive in the nighttime
I've got that Kojo Funds, you've got that fine wine
Twenty-five, I'm just hitting my prime
That good D's got you calling my line
And I've still got the stamina
Two peng tings from West Africa
Had to duck Sharday for Fatima

That ain't my wife my nigga, she gang

She don't care about no Hakkasan, she the baddest, man
And that's so real
Rolls with the gang 'cause she's so trill
Grab me some weed from a dealer
I tell her roll up, my boo knows how to bill
And thats why I'm fucking with her
That's why I'm rocking with her
She ain't ever going through my phone
And I got my trust up in her, yeah
She's too real, she be
The girl that can call me
Whenever she wants me
And she knows that we just be Gs, she

And the safety to my gun
And when it's fist fights or it's gun fights
In the streets, she never run
She dey hold me down
Feds knocking, she don't make a sound
Steady on the grind
Never shy to buss a likkle wine
So all night long, I go give her

Bad Vibe (Acoustic) Lyrics
I'm on a wave
I’m on a wave, yeah-eh-eh
I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, yeah-eh

Me, myself and I don’t need you
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
There's something 'bout them looks, deceitful
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
What goes around comes around, karma
I don't fuss, I don't want drama
You know me and you know, we know, saga
We can go distance, lasting forever, yeah yeah yo
Manners don't deserve manners
Bad vibes don't deserve badders
And the G will run out and vanish
'Cause when you step in, gyal, you have finishing moves
Now you leave a brother really confused
Dem other gyal dem mimicking you
It must be the M.O in you ’cause you’re holding all this naira
Spending money quite fast
Baby girl, you're quite bad
How you do it like that, like that?
Go away, go away, go away, go away
If you’re only gonna bring bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes
Ay-ya-ya
You can stay, you can stay, you can come over here
If you know how to have good time, good time, good time, good time
Ay-ya-ya

Don't want none of that, no, none of that
Don't want none of that, no, none of that, no
Don't want none of your bad vibe, bad vibe, bad vibes

It's your boy, Eazi

Never been the type to fall in love blind
Boy, you really blow my mind
Yeah, you really blow my mind
Do it everyday, love me every night
Baby, you another kind
Yeah, you really blow my mind
Never have I felt this way for another
Someone to from another
Such a rush, boy, you taking all my time

Baby, it blows my mind
The way you do what you do
Almost too good to be true
My God, I'm so into you
Baby, it blows my mind
So much, I got no words to say
You got that special thing about you
That blows me away, away

Your hands around my waist
The way you make my body shake
While the birds moving in time
Looking into each others eyes
Then you go step by step
Taking away my breath
This is more than just a sign
Boy, you really blow my mind

Never have I felt this way for another
Someone to from another
Such a rush, but you're taking all my time
I know that this is not an illusion
With you, I see my future

Catching Feelings Lyrics
Eyes on me from every angle
Nothing I can't handle
I don't need romance and candles
Didn't know he'd be here
And I never get scared
But I'm scared he's got me in my head

I didn't come here wanting all the feels, no worry
I am not the type to flex on you, no hurry
But I can't control myself
Even though I told myself that
I'm not catching feelings tonight
'Cause I've made up my mind but I got caught up every time
I'm catching feelings tonight
And I don't want you in my head
But you got me

Girls with different handles
Nothing I can't handle
Not here for romance and candles
Didn't know you'd be here
And I never get scared
But I fear the dress that you wear, girl

I didn't come here wanting all the feels, no worry
I am not the type to flex on you, no hurry
But I can't control myself
Even though I told myself that

I'm not catching feelings tonight
'Cause I've made up my mind but I got caught up every time
I'm catching feelings tonight
And I don't want you in my head
But you got me

Decline Lyrics
I was always there for you, oh
I was always on time
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline
And now I don't know about you
But I know I'm gonna be fine
And I gave you my all
So now you call, I decline

Oh you think that you sick when you running it
Now you're belling up my line like an ambulance

Going over budget for the women

Running through the strip with my woes, got Cali on deck get blown
Do you care about your girlfriend or not?
If I tell you what I know it might hurt you a lot
Stress, burn you a lot
Diamonds on my chain got her turning a lot
You know I'm the realest, my pain so deep you can feel it

If looks could kill, I got my eyes on your girlfriend still
I wanna handle her bills
I don't make pop I just pop bottles, then I popped in then I popped out
Then I popped up then I hopped out, in a big whip with the top down
Care about your boyfriend or not
Look at my watch, look at what I flex
Look what I'm on, gal wanna dance with a don

Got me losing myself
And I can’t explain it
Got me losing myself
Mute the voices in my head, my head

So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own

Baby please don’t go, Baby please
Oh Say what you want but I can’t hear it
Baby please don’t go, Baby please
Don’t Go

Torn up letters
So many things I wish I said
I miss the days when
We were young without a care
Skimming stones, feels like the future is behind
And I'm gaining by myself

So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own

Ohsay what you want but I can't hear it

Ghana Bounce Lyrics

Oh
What's is this magic?
I need that magic

Everywhere you go is a main attraction
If your yansh was a house, it would be a mansion
When your on the road it is a distraction
All the things you wear are the latest fashion
See your yansh so big wonder how you function
Your hips to your waist is out of proportion
Trip down your backside is like excursion
You can take my money, I don't mind extortion
Oya bo si nu corner je ka Shey romance
I feel tensed up whenever you dance
O so pe calm down that I should relax

Idi e to gbe ti fun me Alzheimer
Those guys beneath you, aim higher
I'm not the one to judge mi Shey umpire
When you walk, it's like the ground is going to catch fire
I'm a Lyon, you're my Cookie in this Empire
Oshey!
And way you dance it's like an occasion
O fun mi one chance it's like a probation
Doing new dance steps is an innovation
My johnny stand up, you give it ovation
Mo kpa te wo I almost fell in love
You whisper in my ear it's like amebo
You told me stay in one place I no galavant

Tell my lady I'll be back

Running away from immigration
Land of miracle, land of honey
That is the thing they told me funny
Not up here to hot new body
More than willing to serve the country

My country suppose be rich and bobby
But some man just, they do it funny

Come home to mama give her something to be proud of
I rose from the ashes and we stronger than they left us
Slowly from Africa and take it to America
I'm in London, immigration
They can't catch me, it's so nice
I'm in London, immigration
They can't catch me, it's so
They may try to chase us,

As I walk through the water, so many things I see, uh-huh
And then I say to myself, "It’s never as it seems"

'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny

No bad man own your destiny
Leave me alone, let me live my life
Leave me alone, let me live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, make I live my life
Leave me alone, make I live it up, live it up
Leave me alone, let me—

Are we losing control, or is it meant to be, uh-huh?
Now I’ve opened my mind, come and set me free

'Cause I am the one, I rule my world
Nobody rule my destiny
'Cause you are the one, you rule your world
No bad man own your destiny

Look what we've become
Only you can
Leave me so undone
Watcha doing?
Is this all for fun?
Or is it true 'cause
You're not the only one
Watch me go, watch me leave you behind
We? No, these man are lost forever
You don't keep all of your promises
And I won't paint us a perfect picture
So I cannot be without ya
I said no way, no way (No way, no way)
Don't mention my name again
No way, no way (No way, no way)
'Cause I'm done with the games you play
No way, no way (No way, no way)
I don't have the time of day
No way, no way (No way, no way)
Have you gone and lost your mind?
No way no way, no, no way
No way no way, no, no way
Have you gone and lost your mind?

Yo, give it to me easy now
Take time and please me now
I know I'm all for trust
And I don't make it easier
They always speak on us
Can never speak to us
I'm who you think I am
Don't give up on all these birds
If you knew
The things I do
The things I do for you
Baby you know its only you, only you
Fall for you, fall for you
You know they say that love makes the wisest man a fool
I fell for you

Oh My Gawd Lyrics
Knock knock, guess who's coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer in a Beamer

Oh my gawd, I've never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop, come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk, I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together, multiplied by six
Oh my gawd, I've never seen a bottom like this
See the way she hula-hoop, come and jump on like this
See the junk in the trunk, I had to bag her right quick
Feel like magic all together, all together by six
She say she got a partner, me, I got one
But me wan' tap, what a conundrum
Never seen a girl, wey give me vibes, suh
Never seen a girl with biggie bum-bum
You know me got a lot of girls around me
Steady give them love, give them the honey
And that is why they love to, love to, love me (Ay-ya-ya-ya)

Knock knock, guess who's coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer in a Beamer
Guess who's coming to dinner?
Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah (Zagadat)
You nuh say your girl what me want
And I'ma give you whatever you want
So, baby, come give me some love
Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah

Oh my gawd, oh my gawd, oh my gaw-gawd
I've never seen a bottom like this
Oh my gawd, oh my gawd, oh my gaw-gawd
I've never seen a bottom like this
Oh my gawd, oh my gawd, oh my gaw-gawd
I've never seen a bottom like this

Yeah, we done up and plus the pum pum tun up (Brr)
Stranger, looking for some danger
Ride it like a bad gyal, face of a angel
This one here ah Major, UK out to Asia
Pull out in the Range, got him beepin' like a pager (Oop)
You nuh say I'ma give you what you want (What you want)
You know I got a body you could flaunt (Flaunt)
You let me come first, I'm in the front
He like kickin' it with Chun', I'ma diss him when I'm done
'Cause I'm back in my bag, throw your rag, throw your flag
And I'm runnin' up the tab 'cause I love poppin' tags
Got Moscato in my cup, poppin' bottles in the club
He said, "Knock knock," I said, "Who's that?"

Guess who's coming to dinner?
Fred, Mr Eazi, Major Lazer in a Beamer
Guess who's coming to dinner?

Playground Politica LyricsTake me back to Nigeria, 1999
Back then I was happier, sunshine on my mind
Sippin’ juice with Jessica
No playground politica
Take me back to Nigeria
No, I don’t wanna play
I’m so high on the swing
And I’m not coming down
I’m not coming down
You can keep screaming my name all you want
I’m never gonna break, I’m not like
Humpty Dumpty
Humpty Dumpty

When I’m on the swing, I come alive
I push my sneakers to the sky
And swing away the bad day
Boy, I wish that I could fly
And flick my jolly lollipop
Take me, take me away
Take me back to Nigeria, 1999
Back then I was happier, sunshine on my mind
Sippin’ juice with Jessica
No playground politica
Take me back to Nigeria
(Nad ned, nad ned, red aleh, aleh vered)
Take me back to the days
When I dey jump around and dance all over the place (yeh)
We no dey look Uche face
‘Cause we know say mummy and daddy gat us whatever the case (whatever, whatever the case)
No time for yama-yama
Lanre got me the juice
First kiss was jaga-jaga, still I thought it was cool
I still remember football ‘pon the road

Whatever You Like Lyrics(It's whatever you like)

Girl what you want
Anything you want
Just tryna get in front of you
Only if you want me to
Whispering in your ear
Wind blowing in your hair
I can't help but just to stare at you
I feel like a millionaire
I'll be there in 2, come right down
When we flex in the coupe, top right down
Send a text to the crew, come right round
Tell your ex he can move out right now
I knew when you walked round round round
Body lookin rude, round round round
I dont even wanna creep but we lowkey down
Tryna get you to your seat up in your room right now
(It's whatever you like)

Girl I'm onto you, I just gotta be honest
If I come thru can I leave a heart in your comments?
It's whatever you like
Mi nah inna part time
I don't want a part time, I need all of your time
Mi nah inna part time (zagadat)
I don't want a part time, I need all of your time

You can do anything girl I don't mind (girl I don't mind)
As long as you stay with me all thru the night (all thru the night night)
Give it you my baby (baby)
You nah say mi slow, mi nah HD

Late night get just what a girl gotta do
Can't give it up easy too
Even though I know everything you say is true
Dont hesitate to put that teasing on you
I like to know my nigga can handle a little pressure
So when I make it get wetter, he handle the rainy weather
Tonight I'll be on your time

Girl I'm onto you, {I just gotta be honest}
If I come thru can I leave a heart in your comments?
{It's whatever you like}

I don't want a part time, I need all of your time
Mi nah inna part time
I don't want a part time, I need all of your time
(Verse 4: Wretch 32)
Be specific, girl I need specifics
Are we going 50/50 on the season tickets?
Cus you know it's unrealistic tryna be realistic
When you're going into business tryna double digits
Then I split them with you
Nearly done the splits when you saw the spliffs didn't you?
Took you to the Ritz cus I took the risk with you
You could get a rock how you got a brick with you
The paper that I got girl it's not a big issue
Money affi mek, money affi mek baby
You mi a protect, imma love you like crazy
Every night when we comin out yeah
And in the morning wakey wakey
Man slim but mi nah shady shady
Man dream but mi nah chase the Bailey's
If my vibe it connect with you
Whatever you like is what I'm gonna do

Girl I'm onto you, {I just gotta be honest}
If I come thru can I leave a heart in your comments?
