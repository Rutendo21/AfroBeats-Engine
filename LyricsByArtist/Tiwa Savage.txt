Before na you dey do the caring, calling, texting, chatting
Now na me dey do the things that you used to do
We no longer do the hold on, pick two, last card, check up
Baby I dey discuss games we used to play
Something is missing, something is missing
And I can’t seem to find it, no, no, no, no, no
Something is missing, something is missing
And you better fix it before you make a sister change

Bankroll Lyrics
Big man can't hold my seat, bankroll no empty (bankroll no empty)
Yeah, I promise, dollars they plenty
Yeah, yeah bankroll no empty, yeah
Don't see no enemies, no time for any, uh
Oh no no, bankroll no empty
I no got no time for any, yeah

Ain't got time to be stressed
Way too blessed to be vex
Bank on notes then you best
Add interest and invest
'Cause where I born from, there were no offerings
You either did nothing or went outside and got things
Novikov me tings for some buss tings
Still the kid that can go give her what she wants
Sweet, beat, pose for the camera
Clo-ser, control with your hand up
Hop a lap, big boy present from Santa
Seen plenty of tings but none of dem matter
Queen, queen, all in the stature
Drip, drip, when you open umbrella
All that vim better out then income
Get sweet banana plantain and plantain

Big man can't hold my seat, bankroll no empty (bankroll no empty)
Yeah, I promise, dollars they plenty
Yeah, yeah bankroll no empty, yeah
Don't see no enemies, no time for any, uh
Oh no no, bankroll no empty

Started on an 8-ball
Got it Off White, now I know Virgil
Christian Dior, I'm the Archangel
Dance with the Devil, I'm in Palm Angels

When the ticket man told where I parked ain't cool
Had to move Cane, I was really able

Fuckin' on a bad one and she a whole wife

'Cause I did this on my own without a co-sign
My bros on my spine, they been backing
Real niggas and I got them for my whole life (Whole life)

Beautiful LyricsI got a poster on my wall
That tells me what I could be
I need to be perfect, thin and tall
Then beautiful would be me
Am I only pretty if I'm her?
Must I be a cover girl?
Is there nothing pretty about my heart?
Now won’t you tell me
What does it mean, to be beautiful?
And what part of me isn't beautiful?
I ain't gotta be fly, I ain’t 'bout to jump high
Just to catch a shooting star
Here today and gone tomorrow
I don't know how to be beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And I got this mirror on my wall
That looks at me every day
It tells me ain't nothing wrong at all
Ain't nothing wrong with me
I'm not only pretty but I'm strong
Don't care ’bout no magazines
’Cause what it shows ain't me at all
So let me tell you
What it means, to be beautiful
And what part of me isn’t beautiful?
I ain't gotta be fly, I ain't 'bout to jump high
Just to catch a shooting star
Here today and gone tomorrow
I don’t know how to be beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
What it means, to be beautiful
And what part of me isn't beautiful?
I ain't gotta be fly, I ain't 'bout to jump high
Just to catch a shooting star
Here today and gone tomorrow
I don't know how to be beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Birthday LyricsTiwa Savage!
Everybody turn it up in this club

Champagne poppin' up in this club
Hey, it's my birthday up in this
Everybody standing up in this
Ladies twerk for me in this
Let me see you drop it low in this
Pop champagne, let's celebrate
He say my body sweet like lemonade
Bad gyal I'mma rani guey
Man dem wanna have a taste
Let me see you drop it down low (down low)
Face down, ass up, bring it up slow
Everybody on the dancefloor
Make it bounce just give dem a sample
Hum ahm, bring it back slow
He wants the milkshake without the lactose
Huh, body hot like a candle
Bend over 90º angle
Everybody turn it up in this club (eeh)
Ladies twerkin' up in this club (eeh)
Let me see you jumpin' up in this club (eeh)
Champagne poppin' up in this club (eeh)
They call me a diva, hot like a fever
As you can see, I'm fly no visa
Boys wanna taste it, girls wanna be ha
I don't give it up so they call me a teaser
My body is on fleek (aah)
All bottles on me (aah)
And my man told me
There's nothing to watch if I'm not on TV
Look at the way that I move
When I get in the groove I'm killin' them! (bang)
I do everything that I choose
I'm too cool to follow the rules (great)
Huh, you go girl, work it

Champagne poppin' up in this club (eeh)
Yep, better compose!
And if you a hater, don't come close
I don't have to do a thing, I could just pose
Got boys on a knee tryna propose

All the money in the world can't buy this

Who is doing big things in a big series

Her name is TIWA SAVAGE
So this sort of my own to Tiwa
Slash remix
When I was just a little girl, I asked my mother "What will I be?
Will I be pretty, will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me
"Chigul o, you will never be rich
Until ya market e is big
Chigul o, you will never be rich
Until ya market is big
Ask Tiwa, Tiwa because her market is big, is big
How she did it you need to see, ask Tiwa Tiwa
Baby girl o
Ask Tiwa, Tiwa for her market is big, its huge
How she did it you need to see"
I'm gonna ask Tiwa, her market is biiiig

But I don’t be dependent on you
So you can keep your money on you, you

Fuck with me, you're in a match

Or I do this shit solo
I'm loving this freedom
So don't give me reason to leave ya
'Cause low key I don't need ya

Glory LyricsI don't know about about anybody else
But all I want to do is  live to tell my story
Flowers that you bring at home to smell
Not everybody gets a chance to live
That glory (Ah mmh) glory
Yeah Glory (Mmmh) glory
I wanna live my, my glory (Mmh) glory
You gotta live your, your glory

Some people spend their whole life
Out of searching
But all they know is just
How to keep you focused
And everything we go through
Has it's purpose
Might not be so bad after all
It's a blank check in an open road
But the wrong way is the long way to go
Dreadline in the deep end of the ocean
This is nothin' left between you and your
Glory, yeah Glory (Mmmh) glory
I wanna live my, my glory (Mmh) glory
You gotta live your, your glory

Hurry Up And Wait LyricsSee I normally don't give a second chance
And gravity's not enough for me to fall in love again
And the more I try to hide boy your heart keeps finding me
So I'm done fighting and I'm ready for it all
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
But my heart is on the way, I'm not afraid
I know it seems like such a long way
Baby can we hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry up and get to love
Baby can we hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
So let's hurry up and wait to love
And now I'm slowly learning to trust my heart again
Step by step I'm getting closer to the edge
And if I jump baby tell me you'll be there to catch me fall
If we crash it won't burn this love
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
But my heart is on the way, I'm not afraid
I know it seems like such a long way
Baby can we hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry up and get to love
Baby can we hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
So let's hurry up and wait to love
In my feet, I touched the ground
So high, I'm never coming down
I don't need to breathe, I'm livin' of your love
It's a whole new world, so hurry up and wait
I'm not in love, I'm not in love
But my heart is on the way, I'm not afraid
I know it seems like such a long way
Baby can we hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Love Me Hard Lyrics
No be small thing o
No be smaaaall thing o

Don't wanna be the next man down
Come correct if you go bring it here
You better turn back 'round
'Cause I can see through your smile if you ain't genuine
Tell you what I want, I don't care (Baddest babe!)
Never held back before and I won't today
If it's me that you want
There's only one condition
Love me hard, hard
Harder than you have before (I'll love you harder than you think o)
Love me hard, hard
'Til you can love me no more (I say, I'll love u harder than you think o)
You don't even have to say it, it's too early for that
You can show me with your actions and maybe...
I'll know that you love me hard (Hey!)
Ha-hard, hard, ha-hard, hard, ha-a-ard (I go love you harder than you think o)
You love me hard
Ha-hard, hard, ha-hard, hard, ha-a-ard

You cannot blend in with the crowd
I've got enough of that when I'm on a stage
Bae, you gotta stand out
If im asking for too much, baby you can leave
Tell me what you want, not what I wanna hear
Never held back before and I won't today
If it's me that you want
There's only one condition

Love me hard, hard
Harder than you have before (I'll love you harder than you think o)
Love me hard, hard
'Til you can love me no more (I say, I'll love u harder than you think o)
You don't even have to say it, it's too early for that
You can show me with your actions and maybe...
I'll know that you love me hard
Ha-hard, hard, ha-hard, hard, ha-a-ard
You love me hard

Love Next Door LyricsOhh ohhh
Aw yeah
Aw yeah
Aw yeah

Remember when you said we could talk about whatever?
Well here I am now and I'm faced with this dilemma
Got a skip in my heart, is that the way that you felt
When you first saw mama?
Fir-Fir-First saw mama?
Te-Te-Tell me about your first date
Did you kiss her first?
How did you approach her?
Can you put it into words
Got me going so hard
Don't laugh at this, take me serious
This girl is so serious, she got me so delirious
Papa I think I'm in love with the girl next door
Can't hide this feeling
I need a little advice
Can you tell me how to makе her want me?
Cause it's an еmergency
Don't want no one else to take her from me
Ohh, I need a little advice
Can you tell me how to make her want me?

Ohhh
Oh I get so tongue-tied, everytime he smiles
I'm scared he hears my heart beat so loud I turn around
I'm doing little things like my hair and my make-up
To make him notice, but does he want this?
I-I-If I get a first date, should I kiss him first?
And  he approach me it'll just build up the nerves
Got me going so hard
Don't laugh at this, take me serious
Oh this boy is serious, she got me so delirious
Mama I think I'm in love with the boy next door
Can't hide this feeling
I need a little advice
Can you tell me how to make him want me?
Cause it's an emergency
Don't want no one else to take him from me
Ohh, I need a little advice
Can you tell me how to make him want me?

Baby make time, just a little time for me
We’ve been down this road before
But you keep hurting me over again
Make time (make time)
Just a little time for me
So many tears, so many fears
You're making it so hard to bear
But I’m always here, always here
Stood by your side all the way
I’m always here, i’ve been here
Some other girls will run away
But I’m always here, I’ve been here
Stood by your side when you dey do all the things you dey do to dey make me dey cry eh
Don’t make me regret that I love you
Oh oh I
Don’t wanna be alone, heart broken
'Cause it feels like I’m the only one hurting
Maybe I remember when we first started
You and I, we cannot be separated
Aaah
Even when you right by my side
It feels like we’re miles apart
Things that you did you don’t do them anymore

I don’t wanna go, I don’t wanna stay
Are we gonna work this out, yeah
If you wanna go, if you wanna stay
Baby you just need some space and a little bit of time

Baby make time, just a little time for me
We’ve been down this road before
But you keep hurting me over again
Make time (make time)
Just a little time for me
So many tears, so many fears
You're making it so hard to bear

You walk in with three friends trying to set it off
Yeah I got some things on my chest but I need some more time

Oh just a little time for me

Middle Passage LyricsI was coming home late from work
And I hear the voice from home
I turned and I saw this man
He told me he’s an African
He’s mysterious and intelligent
Has a PHD to his name
He has come to be a king in this land
Go ahead and be all you can
You’re a soldier
And a conqueror
*** is you
But they act like its not true
How they hate on you
That’s why they try to destroy you
The days struggles are true
I place no one above you
*** asoro

My love (4x)

You’re the reason I sang this song
The reason I sang at all
First born, romeo
Ha, this ones for you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (2x)
Hair like the ***
Still like the earth
I sprung like flower
My hearts desire
You’re a soldier
And a conqueror
*** is you
But they act like its not true
How they hate on you
That’s why they try to destroy you
The days struggles are true
I place no one above you

My Type (Remix 2) Lyrics
Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make that shit grip (Montana)
You know what it is when you hear that (Hah)
We got London on da Track
She whispered in my ear like (My type)
Hundred thousand in the ear like (My type)

Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
Bad bitch, I'ma ride the dick all night
Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe
That's my type, nigga, that's my type
New wrist, new whip, ride around dipped (Montana)
I can see why all these basic hoes pissed

Ten, twenty, fifty, hundred (Hundred)
Out of NY, Calabasas 'til it's sunny (Sunny, hah)
Hot boys on that ass for the nana (Two thousand)
And I'ma tap that like my timeline (Yup)
Her ting got a ting and I'm with it (I'm with it)
I know they want the chips like Lennon (Ching ching, Swish)
Smoke trees, palm trees by the villa (By the villa)
To the ceiling, hit 'em by the threes like Miller (Hah)
Big drip, got a crib with the fountain (Fountain)
Fontainebleau, wrist rocky, had to climb mountains (Rock it)
She only fuck with real ones (My type)
Keep it a hundred, get you hundred mil' in ones (My type)

Hennessy on my lips, take a little sip
Privacy on the door, I'ma make that shit grip

Rich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type

Baby, I can call you an Uber
Give you something that you ain't used to
Eyes on me like Medusa
Five figure deals on my jeweler, ay-yai-yai
Don't block my line, line, line
If you talk money, I go like, like, like
Yeah, that's my type, type, type

Ah, rich nigga, eight-figure, that's her type
I'm worth seven but my **** good as my advice
New car black, new bitch light
This is carte blanche, I like what I like
Talkin' too heavy 'cause I ain't walkin' too light
Record doin' some numbers, my number look like my price
A good woman to wife, a bad bitch's advice
This mad woman is both, but now it's really my type
And I got hoes, a lot, a lot of hoes
My bride got hoes, but actually a lot more
Fashion Week, catch a body, after, we see Rihanna
Niggas ain't confident 'til they arm-to-arm with a model
Fashion Week, catch a body, laugh it up in this party
Laughin' at all you thotties that call up your paparazzi like first, yeah
And I don't want nobody botherin' me
I gotta make a movie, not a scene, yeah
It's crazy I'm always with your bae
I feel like Raphael Saadiq

Not Until I Say So Lyrics
X,O smiley faces on your cell phone
Know what you be hiding when you hear the ring tone
Birthday gifts you know i didn't get you
And another thing
You told me that you like the way that things are going
Break up sex and i didn't even know
All these signs i guess i shoulda caught it
You was leavin me

Baby baby baby
This how you gon play me play me play me
But as soon as were far apart
Boy you know your gonna miss me hard
Even if your heart was made of stone
Even if you try boy you should know
You can't let go you can't let go
You ain't done even if you think so
And if you find another one to sharе your world
You'll be wishin it was me and not some othеr girl
You can't let go, you can't
You can't be done with me no not untill i say so
Relationship status single on your facebook
Perfume letters sayin it was so good
In my head i played it cool as i could
And another thing
Lipstick kisses all over your white tee
Braggin to your friends like you ain't got a wiffey
But you get mad when dudes try to get on me
You gotta be kiddin me
Baby baby baby
This how you gon play me play me play me
But as soon as were far apart
Boy you know your gonna miss me hard

Even if your heart was made of stone
Even if you try boy you should know
You can't let go you can't let go
You ain't done even if you think so
And if you find another one to share your world
You'll be wishin it was me and not some other girl

But I know you’d be late, like you always do
And this time I promise to tell you how much I care
And to hold you close cause you mean everything to me dear

And wondering if you’re still near
Wish I could feel the silence with your voice
Now I’m staring at the wall

No no no you have to go to bed now
Because you have to wake up very early in the morning
I don’t want to, I don’t want to
Okay mummy promises
We can read your favorite bedtime story
But you have to go to bed right after
Okay mummy
There was once a girl
In ***
Every morning
Just to sing
Ma mummy and her daddy
So her mommy took her to London
She sang for the queen
And she became a princess
And then she went to Hollywood
And she met a handsome American man
Named Mr Balogun
And then he introduced her
To all the big stars
In the whole wide world
And they loved her
Then one day
As she was sad
And she started to cry
And the handsome American man
Mr Balogun asked her why she was sad
And she said because she wanted to be a star
And sing for the whole wide world
And the handsome American man
Mr Balogun said he will make her a big star
And that’s where it all began

Searchin’ For Love LyricsOh, Lil Eddie & Mya
Yeah, oh yeah
Mr. Taxi Man, keep the change
Another night alone again
I hate this rain, it just reminds me of what my
Heart's missing
I wear a smile so no one sees
How upside down my world has been
Suffering cause I'm loveless and I just can't win
Yeah
Been around the world and back, and hoping
Something gives
A promise that I'm ready to fall
So love please let me in
I can't stand the silence, so loud in the night
Don't tell me I'm the only one who isn't searchin'
For love
It takes two to tango, one to take my breath away
Who isn't searchin' for love today
I'm looking for you I'm not gonna hide it no
Cause who isn't searchin' for love
Daily I work overtime just to keep it off my
Mind
My heart cries at the thought that I may never
Find
Mr. Perfect like my friends, feeling like the last
One left
Suffering even if it takes every breath
Been around the world and back, and hoping
Something gives
A promise that I'm ready to fall, so love please
Let me in
I can't stand the silence, so loud in the night
Don't tell me I'm the only one who isn't searchin'
For love
You might also like
All it takes is us to cross paths and the touch of
My hand
And the magic, just grab it
Let the rest all begin
I long, I long to meet the special one, my future
I won't, I won't stop searching til I find my
Love

Supernatural Love Lyrics
The world says that this love is not good for me
But my heart says that it is
I never loved like this before

You be like seeing the sun the first time
Like I just did a hard nine
And knowing that the check just cleared
You make my problems disappear, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me
And you be reading my mind
And always finish my lines
You take your time, you don't rush me
The clock don't move when you would touch me, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me

I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to me

And you been changing my life
The love like gold, but we shine
It's like you take control of me
The clock don't tick til you would touch me, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me
You might also like
I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to me

K-R-I-T
I'm down to go to war for this love we got
Fight on the field of light
Fly above all the shots that haters take
Why break formation, we own the path
This shit ain't rocket science
We should just do the math, 1+1
It equals the world and all those things beyond
If it gets harder to breathe, I'll be the air in your lungs
Put my life on the line, I do you right every time
Cause what we got is sublime, when you shine
You like this thug ass lady
But if you ever need shelter from the worries of the world
I'm the one that you should run to, baby
You make me sing a bit
There's powers in our fingertips
There ain't no other love like this
I'll prove it, we do it like knowing all the time shifts
And adjust to our rhythms when undercover
I know you the type of queen I would take to meet my mother
And the type of freak that will get me into trouble
I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to meEmbed

My whole body leaner closer to you lately
Even though I know it's wrong
I just give into
The shape of your body, replays in my mind
The sound of your promises, echo in me deep inside
Crave your attention, it compliments my pride
All fired up, with nowhere to go

Thank Me Later Lyrics
You officially tune in to a B-B-B-BK classic, classic

No, I can't remember ever giving out my number
Let alone my address, nuh-huh
You're lucky that I even recall we met
But I forget your name
Could you spell it for me? Go slow
'L' like "You lost it" and 'O' for "Over"
'V-E' for "Vacate" and "Exit my heart"
Baby, I don't want no more
Please get from in front of my door, just go

My heart, it never wants to be loveless
My heart, it really wants you to stay
But it'll thank me later, thank me later
When it ge-gе-gets a-a-all fucked up
Then bo-bo-bouncе o-o-off the ground
Thank me later, thank me later

Little heart, listen to me, he ain't no good
No, no good, no, no good
Little heart, listen to me, he ain't no good
You'll see and you'll thank me later

Don't remind me
Save your flowers, they'll live longer in your yard, yard
Then if they're laying in the trash can under your love letters
Call me cold if you wanna
'C' 'cause I'm careful, 'O' 'cause I'm older
'L' for learning, 'D' 'cause I'm done

Baby, I don't want no more

Then bo-bo-bounce o-o-off the ground
Thank me later, thank me later

You sent me a card in the mail
It simply says your thanks
For saving you from a pain that's so immense
And I will say to you, I always know what's best
For my heart, for my heart

My heart, it never wants to be loveless
My heart, it really wants you to stay
But it'll thank me later, thank me later
When it ge-ge-gets a-a-all fucked up
Then bo-bo-bounce o-o-off the ground
Thank me later, thank me later

It is seem, it is seem real to me
I can only see how life could be
It seem so far away
But now take a look at how my life is really today

I know some gyaldem that copped that from Turkey
I know some gyaldem that really wanna have my yout
And can't even cane roll certy
I know some gyaldem that look good, cook good, work hard
Baby daddy gone, that's a good look
Don't tie yourself to no wasteman, baby
Get a good stepdaddy, you can have more babies

Saving up your wages, tryna own shit
Laughing at your ex 'cause he don't own shit (He don't)

How do good girls end up with the bad guys?
Girls spending money to look like the Kardashians
It's hard in these times of Meghan Thee Stallion (Big facts)

Voodoo Lyrics
Am I sick in my mind?
I think about you all of the time
All day you're inside
Oh oh oh, it kind of blows my mind
It blurs, it blinds
'Cause deep down desire
Oh, don't you know I walk through fire
With which dark disease
Don't let me go
To share it
'Cause you set me free
When you work your magic on me
Oh it's so surreal
Voo- voodoo
To share it
Put a spell on me
'Cause when you work your magic, I'm free
Oh yeah, I know you do
Voo- voodoo

Get on the bounce (Uh huh) all night long (Uh huh)
Work your magic (Uh huh) all on me (On me)
Get on the bounce (Work it out) all night long (Work it out)
Work your magic (Work it out) all on me

Ella es viento y fuego
Mi corazón hechizó
Ella me hizo un voodoocito
Así dentro de mí, ay
Su magia puro amor
Sin truquitos o no
No, ay baby qué divino
Wah, wah, wah, wah, baby
Wah, wah, wah, wah
You got fire, fire
Hey, puro fueguito lo que hay aquí
Wah, wah, wah, wah, baby
Wah, wah, wah, wah

And he knows he's got me adjust one, adjust one
I don't know if I let you tell the story

Can someone, tell me soul, I can go, just let me go
But it's my comfort, pleasure with pain
Just like a drop that's lost on my vein, ah

Cause your ways are just like a drug to a fiend
Without you I feel so incomplete
Can someone, help me call, with the reality
But there's no hope
I'm just a girl so deep in love yeah

Work Fada Lyrics
Hazy boy o hazy boy
Sitting pon a lazy boy
One more hour on tha FIFA
Too far along to play with toy
Tidy and go wash it off
And fix a plate oh hazy boy
Come get to work
Wasting daylight
Work fada o work fada
Or sit back and grow colder
Oo work fada o work fada
Or sit back and envy a shot caller
Shot caller
Top swayer
Heard you say they were pretenders
Salty Lays on tha lazy boy
One more Dos Equis for the lazy boy
If it’ll bring you joy
Coming for ya with no play
So you wan run run run run run the show
So you wan run run run the show
Na so
Na so you wan run run run run run the show
Na so you wan run run run run run run

Nitori a ti fun – a ti fun wa
Ni iye ọjọ ti eda kan o mọ gangan … gangan
Time e no play – stand in the way
And fade out.. fade out… bêë ni
Come find wisdom come fin’ cause
Go read some scripture lazy boy
It weigh on yourself but you’re finding the way
It weigh on yourself but you’re finding the way
It might take you hours
And it might even take you days
You can use your hands
And you can build a house
It might take you years
To figure out the bolts and things
You can build a rocket
And fly the crew to mars

Na so you wan run run run run run run
It’s in the nature of man to advance in this place we in
Unpredictable path we walk
Its not a race we in
And laziness is a sickness itself
When the scripture would help you get the picture
To see the phase you in
Put a spotlight on it
This is not the life you wanted
What makes you get up each morning?
Feeling all sluggish, make some adjustments
Start hustling
Stop dreaming about easy money its nothing
Your recession is too much resting
Too much laying up in the bed
Not manifesting
Who the man I’m addressing?
Get up, Get up

You can use your hands
You can build a house
Oo work fada o work fada
Work fada o work fada

Written All Over Your Face LyricsWhen the world is dreamin’
No one here to listen
Fingers on my skin
Show’s about to begin
So turn off the light
Get into it
Work your magic baby
Turn the heat up slowly
You just love to please
I can never say No
Not when you’re moving down so low
Boy, you’re a mess
But you look your best
Baby, when I’m written all over your face
When I’m written all over your face

I don’t feel like myself
When I’m with anyone else
You just get it right
That’s why I keep coming back
Time after time, and after time
Oh, baby, Oh
You get into my head
With what you do in my bed
Put me straight to sleep
Baby I’m falling deep, yeah
You do the things that make me weak
Boy, you’re a mess
But you look your best
Baby, when I’m written all over your face
When I’m written all over your face

Now I know the flavor of my love
Cause when you kissing me, I be tasting my love
Why you stopping now, boy I can’t get enough
Let’s play a game, spell my name under the covers
While all the world’s still dreamin’
And no one hears me screamin’
Now I know the flavor of my love
Now I know, now I know the flavor of my love
You might also likeBoy, you’re a mess
But you look your best
Baby, when I’m written all over your face
When I’m written all over your face
