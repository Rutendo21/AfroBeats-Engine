I be person pikin, I get feelings too
My mind is split in two, I love you but I love Simbi too
Girl you can just tell me if you want Jimmy Choo
See me, God I knew it too
So many other guys wan chill with you
Now I just want to marry her
Wan buy her designer
Check your window, ka ri ra
It's been like four days, ta ri ra
I don upgrade, my terminal
Two shorties, ma pami na
You know say me I sabi na
Her song is sweet like Ribena
Mummy and daddy njo, boy and girls njo
Omode pe'lagbalagba, oloyun ton lo s'antenatal
Anywhere me I go, say dem love my flow
Dem say Zino get lamba, omode wey get raba, ahn

I be inside playing call of duty
Loving you be my call of duty
Say for loving too I am guilty

She think all I want is sex, and it doesn't make her upset
Girl you have to bring your friends 'cause they all have to meet my friends
And we have a show by ten, so we have to leave by then
Who I be?, dem no get idea, "cause I no dey too show myself

Now I just want to marry her
Wan buy her designer
Check your window, ka ri ra
It's been like four days, ta ri ra
I done upgrade, my stamina

Oh uhh
How come it is past 11, all I’m thinking is you
How come all my deep desire and darkest secrets you know
How come I no fit talk, how come I no fit chop?
How come you know what’s up
You turn my world to something
How come you call the shot
How do you know it all
How come how come I'm done
When it comes to your love
How come you make me cum
How come you shark me on
Swear like say you be rum
How come I sing your song
How come I made you wet like I’m the rain
How come I feel your pain
Igi sun mo gi but monkey no dey jump again

Say baby how come
How come? how come?
Is the question I’m asking myself
Could this be love?
How come I no fit talk? how come I no fit chop
How come you know what’s up
You turn my world to something
How come you cut it short
How do you know it all

Say my baby give me vibes on vibes
She love the bad boy setting
She say you be striker, keep netting
She ask me what’s my type
I say I want all of them combined
She no want no one next to me
Oh with her body, girl confess to me
She fuck with Victony and Zino
‘Cause account balance get many zeros
When we in the room, she can take me to the moon
How I dey feel, only me know
Them gon feel Victony and Zino
Girl make you koko your pillow
Baby make you run on the low
Chorus: Victony
Hmmmm
Girlie ya you go hypnotize me baby
Oh colonize me baby

Post-Chorus: Zinoleesky
Call me when you need somebody
Call me when you feeling worried
Call me when you need some loving
I’ll be there
In my heart you living rent-free
Call me when you need some sexing
If you need me for this setting, I’ll be there
Outro: Victony
Soon I go there oh
Na who get bum bum wey dey shake there oh
O fun mi tan tan gbemidebe oh
When you press pon pon, everywhere clear

Say, I've been tryna live
I've been tryna focus
But nobody know us
Gave me love at no cost
Say the rest na bonus, uhn
What you do me no normal
I've been thinking of someone
Can't say "Baby, what's up" now
Shey before I see you, o do la, hmm
Like igbo na ganja, uhn, uhn
Like shayo na bastard, uhn, uhn
Like cigar na cancer
Olosho na person daughter
All the things you do me 
When den thief catch olopa, eh
Say natural disaster
What I got and what I ordered

I remember when I say you last time
You said that was the last time
Until I saw you last night
And then we had a nice time, uhn
Baby girl, it's high time
I have to know my crime
Would you let me use a lifeline?
'Cause these feeling's for a lifetime, yeah

Don't ruin my happiness
You're the one who's starting this
How I feel about my feelings is my business not yours
But you're bad like your friend
That's why you both move together
I go swear I got you to the end
I swear I'll be your umbrella
I don't wanna get hold by the neck
With my little few, I'm blessed
I don't wanna be by myself
'Cause I'm a mess without you

Baby let’s do that thing
Maybe if you cum, you come to your senses
Organize pool party
Link me with your friends and sister the best thing

Never see a girl like you wey get design
