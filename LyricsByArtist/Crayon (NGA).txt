Won Le Le Lyrics
You know I don't even blame you
You didn't notice us
We started to shine
Yeah

They didn't notice 'til the moment I started to glow
Now pretty ladies drop it lower than konko below
Is that the reason that I carry my shoulders so high?
I guess it's just the arrogance starting to show (Trust me)
Now it's all about the commas when I'm speaking grammar (Woah)
Balenciaga bag under the Agbada (Yeah)
Remember when we couldn't even break bread? (Break bread)
Now I'm sitting at the table observing my manners
