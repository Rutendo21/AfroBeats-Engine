Aleo Lyrics
You might be feeling really down now
You might be thinking you can never make it out now
You might be feeling like I'm gone now
You might be feeling like you're left out
You might be thinking you will never make it out now
You might be feeling like you're drop out
But I got one thing for you anytime that you feel blue
All that you got to do, sing
Cause I got one thing for you, anytime that I feel blue
All that I have to do, sing
Aleo, Aleo, Aleo, Aleo
Singing, Aleo, Aleo, Singing
Tha's what I can say
Aleo, Aleo, be shouting
Aleo, Aleo, baby singing
Aleo, Aleo, louder
All I have to say is Aleo, Aleo
(?)

J'ai payé le gros lot
C'est elle la femme de ma vie
J'ai tout gagné la demoiselle en vaux mille
Elle va porter mon nom et dans son ventre mon petit
C'est moi le numéro 1 validé par la famille
Elle me complète
A me regarder elle a le pouvoir de me rendre bête
Des années qu'on se connaît on ne se lâche plus
Eh j'peux plus déconner elle me perturbe
Et j'veux pas me louper c'est ton cœur que j'ai visé
Mais elle n'a pas idée à quel point je suis épuisé
Même étant fatigué pour elle j'aurais tout tenté
On a fini de plaisanter donne-moi ta main ton cœur est bloqué

Aleo, Aleo, Aleo, Aleo
Singing, Aleo, Aleo, Singing
Tha's what I can say
Aleo, Aleo, be shouting
Aleo, Aleo, baby singing
Aleo, Aleo, louder
All I have to say is Aleo, Aleo

Come ova Lyrics


Hier soir, c'était la folie, snow bunny et ébony, des mélanges très exotiques
Hier soir, j'étais léwé, des bouteilles on a pété, la vida est magnifique
Et hier soir, j'étais léwé, j'pensais à mon bébé, j’t'ai cherché mais j't'ai pas vu
À c'qui p', tu m'as vu mais c'était pas moi, il me semble que j't'ai vu mais j’étais trop loin
Tell me où t'es, dis-moi où t'es pour se barrer, tu me connais, j'suis dans un film
Suis-moi, follow me, j'ai beaucoup d'oseille et la vision, bien sûr que j'vais accomplir la mission
You make a man come ova
You make a man adore ya
Tu rends les hommes très mauvais
You're love is crazy (You're love is crazy)

Fall in Love Lyrics
Ooh yeah
Listen

It feels just like a dream
To sit down here and say
How it feels to fall in love
So deep and yet so real
It's like a fairy tale
To hear what I have to say
And how it seems to fall in love
So deep and yet so real

Fall in love
Fall in love
With someone I never thought
How could he make me fall
Fall in love
Fall so deep in love
In love
With someone I never thought
How could he make me fall
Fall in love
Fall so deep in love
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love

Ohhh, love baby baby baby baby baby I'm on my knees
I just want you here with me
All night, all day
Don't you see, don't you see
There's a burning fire, there's a raging fire
And it's all, it's all for you
Baby I know that you and I meant to be
So I wrote this song for you

Doing things with my lips you don't hear in my songs
Doing things with my lips you don't hear in my songs
I be screaming high notes like we be on a song
I'm sorry I'm just thinking ahead
And all i heard was pussy, she say fuck what you heard
Yeah holiday swags, me i put her to bed
Thеn i followed her orders, i fuckеd what i heard
Now she wet and she dripping
I told her that i'm all yours, other girls end up wishing
I turn you to my mrs
I know that you've been missing
I love it when you heard and taking bout when you listen
And i love it
When you say come again like you ain't hear me right
Cuz you need another round for tonight
Why we're out here in foreign positions, making decisions, its cuz you told me that you love it when i bend it to the left
To the right
Give you from the back
Give you all night
See i'll give all my love
Then i give you insight
So you could see how much i love you inside
And love and money are the only things that i am making
Don't worry bout them other girls they know that i am taken
And they know that I'm focused
A legend in the making
Give it to you non-stop till i see your body shaking
Seaker coming so long you said i remind you of jesus
I swear you got me screaming jeaus
Like damn it i leave you senseless
Fucking with your mind, got you cuming to your senses, (like)

Water dey fall from my eye

Everybody's on the finish line now but then you got a start
All that you want is some applause but you get booеd on the spot
Do you get sick of this sometimеs slit your wrist
When you get your ass out get down and just piss on this
See them laugh in your face now hear them say ohh look at that
You just tryna get your mind straight but these fools wanna chat
Tell me me this just what you you here for get a hold and try to get more
Like he sells rap in the crack store can i get just what i asked for
Look fly on the outside built am patched up on the inside
Middle finger to the world now no apologies no peace out

On Top of the World Lyrics
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They may just run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving
Take it in but don't look down...
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world...

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
Oh yeah, yeah
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something, something
Take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Waiting for this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make you round
But get up now, get up, get up now...
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make you round
But get up now, get up, get up now...

Over You Lyrics
You were clever, should’ve left you when I could’ve yeah
Keep it moving, move along
Yeah you had me but you lost me, time to walk away
Keep it moving, move along

It’s been a long, long time, you’ve been on my mind
Can’t respond by running back to you

Had to find someone new
Just to get, just to get over you
Had to find someone new
Just to get, just to get over you
Just to get over…
I was trying, you were lying, such a big mistake
Now there’s nothing left to do (left to do)
Sorry said, now unpack, time to walk away (time to walk away)

It’s been a long, long time, you’ve been on my mind
Can’t respond by running back to you

Had to find someone new
Just to get, just to get over you
Had to find someone new (someone new)
Just to get, just to get over you (over you)
Just to get over…

Had to find someone new
Just to get, just to get over you
Just to get over…

Pull up, pull up, baby back up, back up
Don’t know what you have till it’s over, over
You’re the former, former, I’m the future, future
I’d never wanna be with you, never, never
Yemi Alade, good girl gone bad, murder was a case when I left ya
Yemi Alade, good girl gone bad, loved you but now it’s over
But I could never never never go back even if I could
No, I could never never go back
And I would never never never roll back even if I could
‘Cause you know baby I never roll back

Right Now LyricsYeh, eh
Na, na, na, na
Sleepless night
All that I could think about was us
And the way that only you know how to touch me
I try to move on
But I know I'm just fooling myself
Don't wanna be kissed, touched, loved
Or give my heart to someone else
I wanna make up right ... na, na, na
But before we make up right ... na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
I wanna make up ... nana, na, na, na
But before we make up ... nana, na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end
Girl I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show
Our eyes that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go
And haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
You are my homie lover and friend
I wanna make up right ... na, na, na
But before we make up right ... na, na, na
Promise me you'll never do it again
Tell me that we'll make it through to the end

Respect to all the man out there
Love outstanding

Why don’t you tell me you love me no more
Baby, I need to know eh
Why you no dey tell me say you love me oh boy
I know you do but I just can't know
Cause I really want to be with you and you already know
But you gotta let this love glow
And if you really love me, you should back it up and let it show
You gotta let this love glow
Don’t go far from me
Baby come back to me

Bonnie and Clyde, Romeo and Juliet ah ah baby
Me and you together, boy what's the fantasy ah ah
I remember the way we used to do what lovers do
Boy it's not okay for you to break my heart into two

Why don’t you tell me you love me no more
Baby, I need to know eh
Why you no dey tell me say you love me oh boy
I know you do but I just can't know
Cause I really want to be with you and you already know
But you gotta let this love glow
And if you really love me, you should back it up and let it show
You gotta let this love glow
Don’t go far from me
Baby come back to me

5 and 6, me and you since the very first day
You be like aburo, you be like kaka oh
Up till the day, yeah
Maybe it's me, maybe I'm just 
But you know me better

Because we used to be laughing
Be wanting to do what lovers do
But you're now far far far far far far far far far from me

You and I were meant to be
That is what you told me
