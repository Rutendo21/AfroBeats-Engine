Bad Since ’97 Lyrics
Man, I've been bad since '97, I never cared 'bout the devil
Mm-hmm-mm-hmm

Man, I've been bad since '97, I never cared 'bout the devil
Since '17, I've been smoking hot like a kettle
Anytime I know it's 'less you know, I never settle
Get it running on a track, I deserve a medal
Or maybe some diamonds, shining on my bezel
I dey on my level, man, I'm stilla rebel
Who you wan dey underrate? Arе you even normal?
Man, I'm on a differеnt lane, not to keep it formal
I dey craze, you know
And just so you know
If I think you're moving funny, I'll be sam loco
'Cause my music is one thing that I take personal
Don't compare me to nobody I dey spice, you know
On a verse, you know
It's impossible
Say you hear I no deliver, must be dumb, you know
Fit be say I really no wan do the song, you know
Or person dey for my back pointing a gun, you know
Mehn, I dey hot
Ori mi gbona bi ina suya

See when we're not around other rappers can score marks
But soon as daddy's home better hide your report cards
'Cause pen wizard on point like the north star
If I see a peng ting, chapi I advance
Mix a little me with that drink inside the glass
If she touches my shoulder while we talk I gotta glance
If I draw wood, call in another round
You know what they say 'bout the devil and idle hands
So I got my palm in the small of her back while we dance
Dani, what's your mind state?
I'm just being frank
Bet it all on myself and I've been on a bender
This ain't a comic strip but I can be your Avenger
No red flags, just a boss in all his splendor
With some nasty thoughts tryna dirty your December

Should I remind you how it sounded
Oh yeah it'll ring in the morning

Season after season don't need to remind me
Want to get you cozy, laying right beside me
Maybe it's the energy that you provide me
Oh you're my weakness and your eyes remind me
Feelings are the only things that ain't defeated
Oh i swear you do not know how bad I need it
Tender love and tender touch, am I asking for too much
Baby don't you feel, don't you feel, don't you feel the rush
So if it all boils down to this
And you ask what i miss
I'll just say a kiss
Ouuh

And you ask what i miss

All I really need is

Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh

Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now

Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night

I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh

Hustle Lyrics
(Carry my hustle For my shoulder)
(Olorun ma je ki n ri ibanuje)
(I’m a one man soldier)

See I carry my hustle for my shoulder
Olorun ma je ki n ri'banuje
I’m a one man soldier
Oh oh oh
Cause if money no dey mo maa maa kan'ra
So even if you don’t do it for me
Do it for my brothers
Oh oh oh
When I was young, I heard people preach about Jesus
Word was "give to Ceasar what is Ceaser’s"
As e dey go, I got my hustle on my shoulders
Jeje ni mo n lo mehn, aani r'ogun akoba
Steady on my grind, I’m focused for many reasons
Been here a couple years, I’m prepping for more seasons
My girl is my motivation, to ba mon mi you should see this
Word to Almighty Allah because He sees this
He sees it all, what’s the above and what’s beneath me
Lone sheep amongst the wolves and yet He shields me
Automatically bon gb'ogun wa yet they can’t defeat me
Cornerstone levels, first to hate me then they need me
Big up to all the girls I dated
Whether you gave me peace or had me aggravated
Took a minute before I made it
That’s a reason I get up on my ass and hustle like I never fucking made it

See I carry my Hustle for my shoulder
Olorun ma je ki n ri'banuje
I’m a one-man soldier
Oh oh oh
Cause if money no dey mo maa maa kan'ra
So even if you don’t do it for me
Do it for my brothers

8 in the morning and I’m yawning, the pillowcase is warm, I should have been up but my alarm didn’t go off
My nightly dream lately been telling me, I’m wrestling with stressing, I’m feeling upside down like Diana Ross
I slide the covers to the side, and throw on my sweat in a vests and I pray a blessing and calculate the cost
What do we give only the living, poverty, prolly be stuck in the jungle, Fuck It, I go hop in the car
I know I’m headed out this bitch so (ooh-ooh)
Guess my family better be rich though
When I leave they need them keys, I may never score but I at least maybe assist though
Uh, I call my nephew just to reconcile
My final scene is the final end, need a rescue now
He told me money ain’t the answer
I’m dirty dancing with faith, when my faith is the only thing that brings the blessings that I have

Oh oh
I carry my Hustle for my shoulder
Olorun ma je ki n ri'banuje
I’m a one man soldier
Oh oh oh
Cause if money no dey mo maa maa kan'ra
So even if you don’t do it for me
Do it for my brothers

I Do Lyrics
Left hook, right hook men I throw
Fight for my spot what I know is I can achieve whatever I put my mind to
The question is, do you want it as bad as I do?
Left hook, right hook men I throw
Fight for my spot what I know is I can achieve whatever I put my mind to
The question is, do you want it as bad as I do?
Do you want it as bad as I do?
Build a legacy make money moves
Believe my team and in what I do
Can't stay idle, looking for what to do
The things that bother me you ain't got a clue
I laugh and smile but inside I'm feeling blue
I know the drill so I stay jiggy with you
But deep inside I'd rather be in my room
I love it when they dance to my tunes
A phenomenal thing I cannot get used to
But I gotta pretend like it's cool
You think it's sweet but it's something that I can't grow into
You think I'm perfect I'm flawed just like you
My heart and dedication's what getting me through
I'm with the challenge I want it, I do, I do
Do you want it as bad as I do?
Do you want it as bad as I do?
Do you want it as bad as I do?
Do you want it as bad as I do?
Tell me do you want it as bad as I do?You might also likeEmbed
 
 
In My Mind Lyrics
Hmm, ohh

I admit, maybe we should have taken it gently
You take it to the limit, you dare me baby
Don't tempt me, baby, don't tempt me
I forfeit, attention the other girls give me
I just got a little bit lucky
You could have killed me, could have destroyed me
'Cause in my mind
I'm Superman and you're Lois Lane
Girl tell me that you feel the same
Take away all my pain
I won't feel ashamed
In your mind, you're only here cause I got fame
And all you do is drag my name
Try to put it all to shame, and it's such a shame
In my mind
I'm Superman and you're Lois Lane
Girl tell me that you feel the same
Take away all my pain
I won't feel ashamed
In your mind, you're only here cause I got fame
And all you do is drag my name
Try to put it all to shame, and it's such a shame

Like I dodged a bullet
One could have thought you're a goddess, you're just Anubis
Here's who you remind me of, remember Judas
You never cared bout the love, I wish I knew this
E ro pe mo kere, gbo gbo werey ton she
Ko tele e wale, anytime I'm outside
O ma gbe 'eyan wale, how many unknown guys
To ti gbe won wale, tell me

You don't do it for me no more, you know
'Cause I found someone way better than you
We ain't made to last, I know for sure, here's to goodbye
And all the shit that I put up with you
Here's how you lose emotion, something you should know
I felt comfortable, I noticed, when I'm not with you
And I have to say I've opened to someone else but you
But here's how you lose emotion, something you should know
Here's how you lose emotion, something you should know
I fеlt comfortable, I noticed, when I'm not with you
And I havе to say I've opened to someone else but you
But here's how you lose emotion, something you should know

Lose emotions
Lose emotions, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Oh, you too troublesome
Always in my business like I owe you somethin'
Oh, you got me somethin'? I don't wanna know
It did not come from your heart so now I'm owing you
I don't wanna know
Well, I'm done with you and the drama too
I cannot stand one more second of this episode
I hope you know, I'm tellin' you
Feel somethin' really different, I be feelin' new, ooh

Never Stopped Lyrics
Sunshine ah hit
Get off the sheets
I say a little prayer and I burn a spliff
Because I still dey breathe, I'm on my feet and I know tons of niggas still hoping I quit jigga
My shit legit, ko si elomi
Not where I want to be yet so I still dey push jigga
And I don't ever fail to bring the heat
And nobody stopping this, so you can watch this

I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now
Much to achieve in my life, I hustle till the sun comes down
Can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now
Oh no no
I'vе never stopped in my lifе so tell me why would I stop now
Know there's much to achieve in my life, I hustle till the sun comes down
Oh you can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now
Para para
Who say Buju no fit sing go tell the motherfucker
I drop 16 bars rounds your favorite rapper
And I'm a singing nigga wey still sabi flow proper
Big giant, Five fo fumb, smell dinner
You're looking at a mix of Burna boy and 2Baba
With a sprinkle of Khalid and frank ocean sha
You get me sha
And you know say these people no dey my radar
See Ayanfe mi gan gan
Ofe shemi bi oun nkan
And she tell me when I don't call
She tells me it's an insult
How you feeling tonight
You see the people jamming tonight
And when the music playing all night
Girl you know I'll be doing you right , later
On in the night you know

I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now
Much to achieve in my life , I hustle till the sun comes down
No you Can't throw dirt on my hustle my spirit you can't bring it down
You know I've never stopped in my life so tell me why you think that I'll stop now
I've never stopped in my life so tell me why would I stop now

Oil Lyrics
Back then many people judgemental
Woni tori igbo te'nfa
Won tun sope I won't go far
All my pain now, I lay it on the instrumental
Oil dey my head can't lie
I swear back then they thought I was going mental
Woni tori igbo te'nfa
But you see now, see, everything going proper
Oil dey my head can't lie
I am blessed, I am blessed
From my head to my steps
Bulletproof for my chest
Oil dey my head can't lie
I am blessed, I am blessed
From my head to my steps
Bulletproof for my chest
Oil dеy my head can't lie

Yeah, anointеd
Send forth from the time that's appointed
Pray for me, they wanna prey on me, hunted
Enemies surround me, 'bout a hundred
Last year I was betrayed by my guys
Lost some relationships, they capsized
I emerged from the water clean and baptized
Spread my wings like playing in back five
God, tell me why I'm persecuted?
He said it's only those that has been recruited
Often he makes it harder for his favorite students
But he will only give you pressure knowing you'll get through it
And that's a blessing, I'm highly favoured man
Count all my blessings like Abraham
Whole family good with major plans
The oil dey my head, I raised my hands

Oil dey my head can't lie
I am blessed, I am blessed
From my head to my steps
Bulletproof for my chest
Oil dey my head can't lie

My father's still alive, my mother's still alive
I'm grateful for their life
And all they've sacrificed
We no too get money, but I know you dey for me
Please bless my family and my friends and bless my company
I no dey ask you for too much, you've done so much for me
I no get sponsor or big brother, na you dey sponsor me
I'm just so grateful, I'm grateful, that's why I go on my knees
As long as your oil is on my head, no one can conquer me

Pray 2 The East Lyrics
Oh yeah
(JAE5)
Pray every day that my brother

And I, pray to the East, every day, every week
That my brothers can eat, that my brothers can feast, oh yeah
And I think I need a retreat, every day, every week
So I rest my feet, oh yeah
And I need to clear my dreams
Let me spend some G's, let me take my seat, oh yeah
Now I'm on a flight every week
And it's just business, no economy for me, oh yeah
It's just business, ah
When I'm jumpin' on a bih, oh yeah
It's just hitlist, woah
When I'm pullin' out some G's, oh yeah
The turn up for the day and the  is for the nighttime
Used to be on blocks now we wavin' from the sky rise, feel like it's my time
All these watches but I can never buy time
Buy a brick if the price right (Right)
Box some books like it's Fight Night (Night)
I just did it for the gang 'cause they my guys (Guys)
Poppin' Xanax for the long hour flight
Land in LA made these packs take flight
My friends looked up, all this time goes by
And I tell 'em to just wait on it (Wait on it)
Join my table, there's a plate on it (Play on it, woah, woah)

And I, pray to the East, every day, every week
That my brothers can eat (Oh, oh), that my brothers can feast, oh yeah
And I think I need a retreat, every day, every week (Oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
So I rest my feet, oh yeah
And I need to clear my dreams
Let me spend some G's (Oh, oh-oh, oh), let me take my seat, oh yeah
Now I'm on a flight every week
And it's just business, no economy for me, oh yeah

Lately I've been feelin' bougie
3AM, I'm playin' UFC and eatin' sushi
Not the type to let you close if you don't really know me
Say not the type to tell them all, so I'm a little friendly
And shout out to my brother Tommy, he really got me
Been buyin', makin' sure my mind and my pocket steady
For the pocket power, we makin' show, we stayin' heavy
Never broke again, young boys, we movin' crazy
For the most, the conversations really 'bout the money
If you no gettin' money, no fi do ceremony
And my God,  pray, I say kill all my shammy
So I'm out here daily
Like my nigga DJ Tillz, let's get to the money
They not be ready
Why pree? No telling
I've been pushin' all the P's, I ain't talkin' pennies
Call up Penelope
Like, "I'm in your city"
But don't pull up on your babe, let's just keep it lowkey

And I, pray to the East, every day, every week
That my brothers can eat (Oh, oh), that my brothers can feast, oh yeah
And I think I need a retreat, every day, every week (Oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
So I rest my feet, oh yeah
And I need to clear my dreams
Let me spend some G's (Oh, oh-oh, oh), let me take my seat, oh yeah
Now I'm on a flight every week
And it's just business, no economy for me, oh yeah

Propeller Lyrics
(JAE5)
Oh-oh oh-oh, yeah-yeah
Woah, woah-oh-ayy-ayy
Oh-oh, oh, say

Been a long time since I learnt to put rhymes together
Spin 'round your block, I'm a big propeller
Came with my team, I came with my brothers
I swear, I'm comin' from Gbagada
Been a long time, I put rhymes together
Spin 'round your block, I'm a big propeller
Came with my team, I came with my breddahs
I swear, I'm comin' from Gbagada (Yeah)
I can't deal with him 'cah he shakes with his left hand
Married to the hustle, the money my best man
Me against the world, my girl my best friend
I sleep in South, and chill in the West End
And I'm ready for war
If ain't about the belly, what you bellin' me for?
What you tellin' me for?
Henny, I must've had a twenty or more
Any more, then I put her in Cappelli Amore
Sixteen, the wrong one to play with, pussy
Big .44 no safety, pussy
We're comin' from Gbagada, niggas wanna claim the gutter
I don't trust any woman if it ain't my mother
'Cause I'm a big propeller
Lean, clean, like sweet vanilla
Remember when I had sleep for dinner
I'ma live and live to tell the story
Everyday I give God the glory
It's been a long time

Been a long time since I learnt to put rhymes together
Spin 'round your block, I'm a big propeller
Came with my team, I came with my brothers
I swear, I'm comin' from Gbagada (Woah, oh-oh)
Oh, been a long time, I put rhymes together
Spin 'round your block, I'm a big propeller

I learned to put lines together before I learned to put lines together
You know me, I stay with it
The type to bill a line before I wait in it
And we're spinnin' the block
Eye for an eye
That's one-for-one like the women I block
'Member days I would chill on the block, no stressin' (No, oh-oh, oh)
Black car, black suit, black weapon
The Henny's a double, they call me double-o-seven (Yeah)

Alle Fotzen, alles falsch, ja, das lernt' ich
Weil bis heute war noch keiner zu mir ehrlich (Nein, niemals)

Times Two (X2) Lyrics
New money in the bank give me energy
Big champagne splash on my enemy
Can’t let no man get ahead of me
Oh, I know they know we up right now

I got zero women on my line
Zero women on my time
Money day for my mind
Ain’t got no time-ooh
Shey no be when you call me I go dey?
You know I wouldn’t want it any other way
‘Cause I dey shade who say I no dey there?
When you need me
Gumbody times one or times two (Two)
Girl you know I’m crushing on you (You)
Your body e bе like banku
Make we Gumbody timеs one or times two
Gumbody times one or times two
Girl you know I’m crushing on you
Your body e be like banku
Make we Gumbody times one or times two

Woman no wan hear say
Money no dey
Dem go run a runaway
Woman no wan hear say
Money no dey
Dem go fly a fly away
Fine girl my little east side shorty
Way back na me dey rock her body
Way back na me dey dash am money
Way back she been dey do me conny
Life so funny
I used to have so many hoes on me
So far as my eye can see
Manna went cold and they froze on me
I have nobody
Manna got so many flows on me
With a big bankroll on me
Till the day that money comes slow for me
Fuck everybody

Say they want to link for vibes
On my neck, it’s ice water, ah-ah
After the club last night, ah-ah
Wake up with hangover, ah-ah

This is not another chorus, just another bonus
Mr Nacademus said they wouldn’t pay us
After all the work wey I put in for Lagos
I was wilding out and they thought they could tame us
Blame it on features
Some underrate us
But it’s only ’cause there’s nobody that made us
I’m the one that’s disturbing artists on labels
After this I might book me a trip to Seychelles or Antigua
Ma lo pa mi na
Please do not compare an AK to a damn Luger
Alubarika, ni mo n gba proper
Used to take a bike from Mowe straight to Gbagada
Now you dey you see me now
G63s AMG, and my engine make the ladies go, “OMG”
And my tank always on full, e no fit empty
I’ve been thinking ’bout a lot and e too plenty

Wo wo (Wo)
Too many things I dey think, wo wo (Wo)
I never talk anything, wo wo (Wo)
Dem don dey do shakiti bobo
Mmm-mmm-mmm, on God (God)
This life e sweet but e fit, wo wo
I pray to God make my blessings fall
Big flex
Reset
Don’t get it twisted
I still flexing
Thank God that we still flexing
Thank God that we still flexing
On the block and they still searching
Rich as fuck and we still stacking
Six bed mansion for this Lekki and I no kill person
I came in a Benz o and a Mustang o
Blowing up the endo, shit is hard
Said she wanna tango, never gon’ let go
I know ’em when I look her in the eyes
Omo make nothing worry me, yeah
Just touch down from oversea
When e no fresh nobody see
Talk to me nice, not authority
Moving with currency, I’m on that foreign P
And if you don’t know
Omoge po
Bebe n lo
I no dey take them too serious
She say she love my new lifestyle
Thank God say she no know me before
Back when things, wo wo

Too many things I dey think, wo wo
I never talk anything, wo wo
Dem don dey do shakiti bobo
Mmm-mmm-mmm, on God
This life e sweet but e fit, wo wo
I pray to God make my blessings fallEmbed
 
 
Your Body Lyrics
Basket
Duktor

I ain't built for love and you know
She stated facts I denied that
Your time will suffice, girl, you know
I got some things I wanna know

Are you really mine?
Are you real, girl, are you genuine?
Say what you like, girl, what you really like
It's goin' down tonight
Tell me the truth, girl, are you really mine
Are you real, girl, are you genuine?
Say what you like, girl, what you really like
And it's goin' down tonight
Make I touch your body
Na you wey I want to kolobi
Make you no send anybody
For me baby shey you go soji (Goin' down tonight)
Make I touch your body
Na you wey I want to kolobi
Make you no send anybody
For me baby shey you go soji

Sorry I'm late, girl, I been on my way
I just had a little delay
In fact, very first day when you came to my place
You made me feel some type of way
I say sorry I'm late, girl, I been on my way
I just had a little day
In fact, very first day when you came to my place
You made me feel some type of way

Are you really mine?
Are you real, girl, are you genuine?
Say what you like, girl, what you really like
And it's goin' down tonight
Tell me the truth, girl, are you really mine?
Are you real, girl, are you genuine?
Say what you like, girl, what you really like
And it's goin' down tonight
You might also like
Make I touch your body
Na you wey I want to kolobi
Make you no send anybody
For me baby shey you go soji, so-soji

And it's goin'
Go-goin', goin'
Goin' down tonightEmbed
