2020 Letter To You Lyrics
Manage your state, magnify your office
Comport yourself be true to yourself
I live this life at a pace that any man can go
Know your place and dedicate your role to the fate that you will die alone
Man gave us love and God gave us time
It’s the act of storytelling I’m only telling now
Love and hate oh oh, black or white, right or wrong, so oh who is right
I be human oh you be human too
Ohhh nobody perfect onto one or two
Eh nobody jaaju kaku or no over kaku
Life na one part omo no part two
Ye, I go chop my life mi o le wa ku

Faccio freddo e non sto in Alaska
Non tipo te, che caldo, 'na brasca
Con due pezzi e una cassa
Ti senti rockstar, ma che ti passa
Ma da', ma dai, fra' (Oh)
Lascia, lascia sta' la trap con quell'Euphon
Che ti fa un po' male
Se ti fai due tiri, ti gira la testa
Tipo Xan' (Oh)
Io con quella merda mi sono perso
Per passarvi il peso di quel che penso
Credo per un po' che andrò in
Alaska-ska-ska
Ognuno ha bisogno di staccare, staccare
Volevi me, ma a me non basta, basta
Fare finta che per me sia okay stare così
Alaska, fai 'sta J
Fra', non contare che sto in ansia
Correvo pеr togliermi dal cazzo 'sti qua
Ora che sono partito, non torno, scordatelo, fra'

Girl, arе you shakin' for me?
Put in, no textin' from me
Girl, are you dancin' for me?
Girl, are you dancin' for me?
You made me wait, bunny
Fly away from me
'Cause, girl, are you dancin' for me?
Girl, are you dancin' for me?

Tomo el beat, mai', y te alcanzo Saint Tropez
Cuando estás encima todos tienen que joder
Manuel es tu cumple, mira, preparé el pastel
Maldita las mentiras que me tengo que creer
Yo sé que doy fastidio con mi cara
Tomé todo a mi mamá, suerte que soy su bebé (Bebé)
Son diez años que lo rompo de patada'
No salgo para ustedes, yo salgo cuando quie' (Cuando quie')
Bad vibes, bad vibes a mí no me matan
Yo soy machete, vos sos navaja
Supreme, Young Miles me dan la ventaja
Yo lo hago solo otra vez (Gang, gang, gang, gang)

Ora R.I.P., quasi muori congelato nel mio drip (Uh-ah)
L'arma "click", passa, conto e ricordo il conteggio
Eravamo figli di puttana, ora peggio
Freddo, so che c'è un altro nel tuo letto
Cinturini coi diamanti metto, ue (Uoh)
In chill al bar della mia via, uohi
Bambini con la mia suoneria, uohi
Mentre la verità non la spaccio
Con lei non serve rompere il ghiaccio, mai più (Ah)

Back When Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
On the beat
Yes o
On the beat is Davido
And Super C

Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
Dem dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the club DJs don dey play me
Now they don dey follow
Everybody wan snap photo
Looking like I just hit the lotto
And you know that my neck is froze yo
And I am popping Rose
Every night na money we dey trowey
Balling from Monday to Sunday
Balling from Monday to Sunday (Sunday)

And I’m counting owo
I’m known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo
And I’m counting owo
I’m known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo (wash me like omo)

Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me, want to play me
Ma nogere, ma nogere

Everybody just want to be me
Nobody just want to free me (just want to free me)
And I am talking my way
These days I be wishing my way
All the girls from Funke to Laide
Bad girls, from Funke to Laide
Bad girls, from Funke to Laide

And I’m counting owo
I’m known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo

Kilode today
Awon boys don hammer
By, just being an MC
After doing what needed to be done
They say I ball too much like Testes
Recognize a boss when you see one
Not in the same tax bracket that you belong
Like the next on Jurassic pretty girls just dey be long 
To all the haters who exchanges things small or less
My money they say cut like money fresh
Not matching Mohammed, I mean Benjamins
Whole ‘nother class, not talking about the Benz I am in
Got the lightning before but then again that's okay
Tweeting nowadays your body jowo soke
See me sharing money like communion to last
My flow too tight like the lungs have asthma

Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me, want to play me

Meet me at the crib no dolphin
So I can show you who the real boss is
Got my mojo back no Austin
And her favorite color green like Boston
And when I'm gone, she misses me
She’s 5'5, I'm 6’3
And I don't know why, I don't know why
But she loves tall guys
I got the height
And I got the weight

So let's beat some meats

Checking out some beaches
Smelling like the oromo

Never care what dem say (dem say)
I'm tryna chill like Bahamas breeze on midday, comprende?
True la, she a dime, two fives

Stayed down in the trap, man, I gotta be great

Got a full plate but I already ate

They pocket watchin', tryin' see what we make

Der Wackste Macht Das Licht Aus Lyrics
Der wackste macht das licht aus was bringt dir doubletime
Du faggot hast battleraptechnisch nichts drauf
Und ich wette du mädel gibst auf
Nach einer standardphrase die du ja bekanntermaßen anders wahrnimmst
Erstmal die anderen fragen - "was meint der Jephza da"
Dich - "ach aber bei parkbänke disst der casper wa"
Lern denken auch wenn deine synapsen quer lenken
Lehrt dich gangsterrap du hast gehirnmasse zu verschenken
Du willst einbrecher werden der lord in deiner weststadt
Ich wünsch dir viel erfolg auf gefrorenen gewässern
Leih dein ohr mal kurz dem Jephza - ich chop es dir ab
Was Hip Hop zurückbringen ich schließ den kofferraum ab
"ich fick dich locker du spast" - fuck rede nicht von dingen
Die dich garantiert umbringen würden du Kind
Ich bin objektophil und das mikrofon muss verhüten
Nennt sich popschutz und versaut mir grad ein riesiges vergnügen
Der wackste macht das licht aus
Auch wenn ich meist relativ depp rapp
Heißt das noch lange nicht dass ich euch nicht auseinander nehmen könnte

Drück den schalter ich kann das nicht erledigen
Bei uns sind alle dope nur bei euch könnte das jeder bringen
Mich interessiert eure illuminatischeiße nicht
Aus internetbewEisen formt ihr weisheiten - leider nicht
Ich leb im hier und jetzt bitte vergebung herr
Koran und bibel sind für mich bloß bücher - und ich les nicht gern
Und du fragst dich "ey kann der das sagen"
"er kann" - ich sprech für mich du punk
Ich hab ein loses mundwerk du 'ne dicke lippe nun der clou
Ich bin Jephza du lediglich benjamin bueford blue
Und du denkst dir noch "oh nanu das konnt ich grad noch nicht raffen"
Kurz zurückspulen "kollege es wird nicht klick machen
Nein - dass über dich weiber lachen ist true - schade
Keiner hilft dir bei deinem eingewachsenen fußnagel
Keiner freut sich den spast zu sehen weil du kacke bist
Keiner - ach geh zum vbt da ist noch platz für dich


Du drückst den schalter denn du weißt wer jetzt am zug ist
Ich mach das einfach aus leichtigkeit weiß dass du nicht gut bist
In dem was du verkörpern willst und in deinen tracks so gern erzählst
Nur schade dass ich im gegensatz zu dir nach echten werten streb
Weil du mir auf die nerven gehst vermeide ich kontakt zu dir
Hab leider nichts zu tun mit dem kreis an den du appelierst
Tut mir leid dass wir live am mic einfach deine crew nageln
Ordne sie dann anschließend ein in die letzte schublade
Die crowd ruft nach zugabe während ich in deinem blut bade
Doch ich konnte einfach nicht mehr drauf vertrauen was du faselst
Zerleg dich im Handumdrehen ohne das du es merkst mann
Internetbattle - cool auf der bühne bist du verkehrt mann
Zerdresch dich nebenbei und bleib dabei ganz lässig
Am mic wirkt deine hässliche fresse zerbrechlich
Erstaunlich und entsetzlich was du so auf deinen tracks kickst
Gib dir 'nen ruck mach das licht aus weil du wack bistYou might also likeEmbed

Feel Alright Lyrics
It's Davido, eh

Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright

Pass me your love make I feel your life
No do me wrong, I go do you right
You no go ever leave me, na lie
I take you to paradise, paradise
You left me alone, alone in the dark
I'm hungry for you love
Girl why, I'm so in love, e be like say you be dey plan for me, you dey plan for me
Eh
Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright

And if it's money that you want, you know I gat it, gat it, girl you know I gat it gat it
And if it's loving that you want, you know I gat it, gat it, girl you know I gat it gat it
Baby why you dey complain, baby just dey maintain
Why you just complain, sit there just dey maintain
And if it's money that you want, you know I gat it, gat it, girl you know I gat it gat it

(Ice Prince)

Yeah, oh
It's all good, now I'm blowing perf
See every time you scream, got me going tone deaf
You're overseas and I am trying get my own jet
So you ain't gat to worry about a nigga having phone sex
Ain't nothing compared to when we both flex
But when we argue you got me shaking on both legs
Now all the smileys and cute faces in those texts really means shit no more, kinda of gross yet
You forget about the sick romancing
How you shake a nigga head is like sisqo dancing
Fryna be your bad boy, you pick those medicine
I ma go to J'burg and let the chicks know something
But currently I'm ego ranting, you ain't got enough to hear me, no eco sensing
Set things straight, mama me no blanking
If you tryna push aside, well me no skanking

Two or three gyals not enough for me
Give me, give me more, not enough for me
Dutty whine, you're the freak of the week
Step, step, step to the party like an OG
Party jumping, neighbours can't go sleep
Now the neighbours tryna call the police

Buy her a Birkin, make it look cheap
Looks so sweet, dunno how she looks street

Like my cars prestige, George flawless
Di Sauvage fragrance smell gorgeous

Look, she come through and show me nuff' love
Got dropped in the field? Boy tough luck
Thought you was the real deal, but you mucked up
African queen, come sweet like my puff-puff
Forget them man, they ain't like the rest of us
Done the kid wrong it happens to the best of us
But that's the way that it goes
Hope for the best and we break in your home
Smoke to the chest and it's caving my dome
Loads of the peng and it came in a boat
I ain't got time entertaining a hoe
'Less she got time to be taking the bone

If you wanna eat it no pressure

Your injury is fake like Nelly with a plaster
If you want the ghetto P, then you better be a rapper

Hood Muziek Lyrics
Ark
Bang Bros
Misschien ben ik niet de beste, maar wel de vieste
Ik doe dit voor de hustlers, fraudeurs en de dieven
Ik doe dit niet voor mannetjes die praten en niet schieten
Ik doe dit voor die mannen die niet praten en die squeezen
Doe dit omdat ik wil, dus jullie zijn gedaan homie
Zeg je mannen chill
Ik doe dit voor m'n cash man ik stack heavy
Zeg je mannen doe je best maar ik ben ready
Broer ik ben een pro in smoken, hangen en niks doen
Maar je proeft mijn ballen als je een bitch zoent
Free Green Gang, soms draagt de kid groen
Het is nog steeds fuck rap, ik wil een miljoen
Kleine money op de bank, en cash ook
Naast dat rook ik blunts in de airco
Ik denk groot, net als de tour met m'n Bang Bro
Naar boerenjongens en dan vragen naar wat Hef rookt
In de P.C. met money van zes shows
Ik ben die vieze maar nu zien ze dat ik dress ook
In de hooptie maar ik plank 'm zo van let's go
Ehh, ik kan je leren hoe je cash blowt
Smeer 'm met de money en ik wrijf het in
Doe nu ook workshops, homie schrijf je in
Ik krijg hoofd backstage broer I get it in
Ik wil een milf met money als de koningin
Dit is die hood muziek, die pof pof push muziek
Die zingen in de douche muziek
Niet fucken met een nigga ik ben frooz muziek
Dit is die vinger-in-de-poes muziek
Dit is die hood muziek, die pof pof push muziek
Die zingen in de douche muziek
Niet fucken met een nigga ik ben frooz muziek
Dit is die vinger-in-de-poes muziek

Maken van een gram een kilo, een kans rep 
Van de straat naar 'n CEO, maar wacht, tranquillo
Mijn boys staan klaar voor de baas, en ze checken je bord, casino
De  show, rapido
Over de track, Rotterdam, waterweg, Speedo
Snelle geld speedo, opent elke deur
Landelijk, ProRail, zn bitches strippen, de conducteur
Heeft de game onder controle, fokt op in me snollen
De man verscheen en maakt je zwart, zonnen
Valt niet mee te sollen, hart van steen stollen
ZJ, jullie weten hoe we rollen
We stashen dough, pushen, over de grens ook
Fuck niet met een baas want hij weet hoe die Bang Bros
Een Badboy, mijn pleidooi, ik play nooit

M'n goons pompen dit terwijl ze moven met een brick
De scene weet van niks, begrijpen never wat ik spit
Hoe bedoel je bent een vieze nigga
Je bent de type nigga, die rent wanneer die moet bangen nigga
Bang bang, murder murder was de fucking deal
Labels willen smooth doen maar die mannen praten kaka deals
Praat money met de kid, een  op m'n whip
Al m'n hood niggas bangen voor hun chips
Zeg die mannen wat het is Aiky
Ik laat niggas rondjes rennen voor het zitten aan mijn fucking Nikes
Bijlmerstyle, m'n niggas blijven gooned up

Ik doe dit voor de ballers, de goons met de clips
Ik doe dit voor m'n money m'n vloes en m'n chips
Ben je in de streets ik heb dan connects voor die bricks
Yeah, m'n Turken draaien in je hood
Draaien in die beamer, ze supply-en heel je hood
Oki, ik ben vierentwintig zeven op mijn cake
Hef en ik blowen money als Baby en Drake
Puff 'n haze, tjappen steaks
En ik superman hoes met een T op m'n cape
Vorig jaar was ik focked up, nu ben ik oke
Je chick checkt me in de club ik neem die hoe mee
Vieze Turk met een beetje loot
Lobi in de streets spit game in de booth

Would you be, would you be there for me?
Girl, would you, girl, would you care for me?
Would you come running for my needs on the double?
Come and bail me out when a nigga get in trouble
Give me that loving wherever we lie
Poke, poke, poke, poke in the back of my car

Ooh, you make me wan' say

Brace yourself, girl, 'cause I'm dangerous
Might be bragging, but I backs it up
So come try me, try me
Girl, you, girl, you, girl, you won't regret what I give you
Love like no other lover

Juice Back (Remix) Lyrics
Man man man you should hate yourself (I see ya)
Look into a mirror, nigga rate yourself (I see me)
Look at the shit that we doing
Motivate yourself (One hunnid)
Brace yourself

I done got my motherfuckin' juice back (Yeah, woo)
I done got my motherfuckin' juice back (I got my juice)
I done got my juice back (Yeah)
I done got my motherfuckin' juice back (Woo, woo)
Motherfuckin' juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice
(Okay juice)
Hey where my juice at?
When I got robbed where were you at?
Gun cocked to my face like "Where my jewels at?"
Made a couple calls and got my juice back
Yes I got the, yes I got the juice like woah
Looking for a young mamacita that gon' make that booty move like "Woah"
Bad bitch in designer, yeah she Gucci head to toe
I hit it once again now she don't wanna let me go
And she already know
Say, I got the juice, got the juice (Oh yeah)
I'll make it juicy for you
Yes you can come with a friend (Nigga)
I'll make it juicy for two (Nigga)
Me no give no attention to no hater
Nigga you less and I'm greater
I’m on time and you late
Told my brother Nasty C "You made it"

Man man man you should hate yourself (I see ya)
Look into a mirror, nigga rate yourself (I see me)
Look at the shit that we doing
Motivate yourself (One hunnid)
Brace yourself

Motherfuckin' juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice
(Okay juice)

Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is-
Fuck that, I ain't got tell you what my name is
By now you motherfuckers should know me
I did so much with my career that even my peers treat me like an OG
And the OG's throw me subtweets
I just laugh at it cause trust me
I'm like Bieber now, you can't touch me
You wanted relevance? You should've asked me
Isn't this the greatest story that you ever seen? Dammit!
Did you ever ever think you could see a SA rapper who could buy a Lamborghini? Dammit!
And ever come from Mafikeng?
All I ever needed was a canvas
A couple gold bottles and a bad bitch
They can't stand it but how the hell I ain't gon' rap about money?
When I'm rapping bout my life, and it so happens that I am rich (hoo!)
I mean these niggas were hella distant (Were hella distant)
Until they heard that MTN gave me 7 figures (Ayy, ayy)
Now I'm stunting at the backseat of a Rolls Royce like "Hello Kitty"
O ba botse ka ntwana ya kasi
My crib is always full, I brought the ghetto with me
And this shit ain't never gon' change
These niggas forever gon' hate, cause I'm telecom paid
Ladies love me but the fellas gon hate
Hao ka sheba fela kom kyk
Ke ba tshela bombay
They say I don't spit so I won't quit
I'm in my zone kid, I'm so focused
I made millions but I want more bitch
And I'ma stay filling up the dome 'til you niggas bow, bow, bow
Bow down to Davido and bow down to Cassper
Heard 'em say "Stars are aligned"
But they both had their time and you know that I'm tryna surpass 'em
Fred Merc told me your favourite rappers have heard of me
But a lot of these niggas won't get a verse from me
I feel bad for being the one to school these niggas when my friends are tryna get in a university
But still I made 'em fall like the fees did
Feeling like I'm talking to my daughters and nieces
One of my industry niggas called me this evening
Told me keep my head above the water and breathe in
He wasn't too happy bout who I got on the remix
But he was on the remix before he got on the remix
He replied to the emails before I got on the frequencies
So I plotted the pieces before he had all the enemies, man
I need a lot of head again (Lotta head)
My mind's getting heavy even I wasn't ready
Man my come-up was a run up
Look at all things I did
It started with a mixtape that I dropped in February
And I'm too scared to even tell you what's next
I'm handpicking women out the general section
But I don't save them, no, ain't got no S on my chest
I got a triple Styrofoam with a medical mess
All my enemies are amateurs
My role model broke his character
And all my exes wrote me letters bruh
And I was chilling with Scoop the other day
If you knew what he had to say about you, you wouldn't be rapping bruh
Davido gon' have to take this back to Naija for me
Don't have to tell you why your favourite rapper's hiding from me
I keep the weed stashed in a different kind of luggage
And tell my guy to tip the pilot for me, I got the juice

I done got my motherfuckin' juice back (Yeah, woo)
I done got my motherfuckin' juice back (I got my juice)
I done got my juice back (Yeah)
I done got my motherfuckin' juice (Woo, woo)
Motherfucking juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice, juice

You lookin' for a man, I'm your man (I'm your man)
I ain't gonna run if the cops comin' (No)
Oh, no-no-no
I'ma run 'cause your love callin', and so
If I get caught, baby girl would you come bail me with dough?

Know Your Worth (Remix) Lyrics
He keeps leaving you for dead
I don't know what you been waiting for (No, no, no-no, no)
So you've got your love locked up instead
But somethin' better's waitin' at your door

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

It's been three years, still countin'
You in love, but still doubtin'
If he's in love with you (He's in love with you)
(Find someone who loves you)
Omoge, I know you got that vibe
Shey him dey do you well ?
Shey him dey make you smile ?
Shey him dey treat you right ?
Are you happy? (Are you happy?)
(You don't know your worth)

You need real, you need love, you need time
And I know that, you been gone, you been done, you been tryin'
I know I can get it

Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you're feelin' down
You get strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found

You don't know your worth (Worth, worth-worth)

Watching you walk grab all of my tension
Super bad girl, you might need attention
Come to me, follow me right to my section
What you drinking? Bad girl, I no make it
Straight shots, we don't do no chasing
Brace yourself, girl, you need some patience
The way you licking them lips, I want to taste it
Right now, I'm tired of waiting
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Girl, what you plan to do?
If you came with your friends
Tell them that I got you
And baby, we can take it all (Yeah yeah yeah)
Baby, we can hit it off (Oh yeah yeah yeah)

We were taught to do it, you can't blame nothin’ on us
We was geeked up off that angel dust
I pray to God that this train don't get busted
I was spendin' racks, stackin' by, yeah
And I been doin’ it big since I was little
No mac in the middle, couple grand for my Cartiers
Listen up, now don't you play with none of them boys

Lie for You Lyrics
No, no
Ay, ay, no
Oh, I'd lie for you

You call, baby, I run
Don't need to know what you done
See you, holding that gun
I don't need to know
They come, running for you
But I know it ain't true
Swear I'll cover for you
They don't need to know
All the things that I'm thinking of, lately
Don't need to say you already know, it's crazy
Let's jump on a plane or just run, baby
You don't have to do it alone, whoa
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you
And even if I couldn't, I'd try for you, oh
You got me and I know this
When you're losing I'd notice
I'd lie for you
Even if I shouldn't, I'd lie for you

Shawty, an angel
Came down from heaven, the space she I feel inside you
I know your intentions, follow your directions
'Cause you a blessing in disguise
I won’t lie, you relaxing my mind
Even when I got something bothering my mind
I stopped searching when I found you
Take your crown, my chargie
'Cause I dey really feel your vibe
When I'm down, girl, you recharge me
'Cause, baby, I really wanna change your life
Baby, I wanna see you bend, oh
I know you know say you be 10, oh
Bad girl from the ghetto
This love, I no fit, let go

Don't say you love me, talking rah, rah
You say you hate it when I see you cry (Cry)
You was my favorite 'cause you match my fly
Look, baby (Baby)
I could've left you when I fall, but I ain't that type
You lookin' for love, but I ain't that guy
Hit him in his slugg, had to paint that guy
'Cause he ain't down to ride
Thought you was my homie, wanna take my life
Talk behind my back and that's gon' get you sidelined
Most of these rappers be livin' fake lives
I hear them talking through a grapevine
I'm too original to fake mine
I, I broke her heart and let her take mine
I broke out her back, she needs another spine
Said, oh, I'd lie for you
Oh, I'd lie for you
I can be your ears and eyes for you
Oh, I'd do time for you

Money on your 'ead like a Naija
Ayy, ayy, like a Naija

Karma when we fry up man
I put money on your head like a Naija man
Gyal throw K's on the net, but see us in the flesh
And, always get shy with man
I just put a 5 on my feet
Everybody lookin' like "Ooh, he a pricey man"
Karma, karma when we fry up man
I put money on your head like a Naija man
You know that I'm steppin' in fashion
Designer splashin', #IDontSlipUp
Pretty one, way too attractive
I've gotta have it
I think I've got my hands on a winner
Loose, I'll turn your main man to a swimmer
Trap mash 'nuff and them bands comе quicker
She wan' a Harlem Boy, oi
Cah shе heard that Harlem's realer
OMG she pretty, pretty
Always get shy when she see me, see me
Barbies are throwin' up K's
And they scream "Free Mizzy, Mizzy"
Me like "Where are ya, silly, silly?"
I got bassy on me not a flicky, flicky
Aye on the other side to go fishin'
Mad Man done him, what a pity pity

Karma when we fry up man
I put money on your head like a Naija man
Gyal throw K's on the net, but see us in the flesh
And, always get shy with man

Next to You Part II Lyrics
Hey Rvssian

Do you remember when I met you in the summer?
Sipping wine, we talked for hours through the night
And you asked me if I'd like to know your number
For me to call and say that I got home alright

But, oh, we fell so deep
I had a lot on my mind
I wasn't ready to find you
'Cause I was so naive
I do this every time
I wish that I could rewind it
Are we a drop in the ocean now?
Oh, I know that I let you down
All along I was searching for something new
Oh, and I should've been there right next to you
Ooo, I should've been there right next to you

I should've been there right next to you

Even though you say I love you
I just wanna be right next to you
I just wanna see the best of you
I just wanna see you out with your radar
I wanna fall in love with you
Falling with no parachute
And even though you tried to call me
You know I'm on my way
On my way (Yeah) on my way
On my way faster to you
On my way (Oh) on my way
On my way to find you

I was so naive
I do this every time
I wish that I could rewind it
You might also like

Oh, I know that I let you down (You down)
All along I was searching for something new
Oh, and I should've been there right next to you
Ooo, I should've been there right next to you

I should've been there right next to you
I should've been there right next to you

Cuando te acuerdes esa noche junto al mar
Haciendo cosa' que no pudiste olvidar
Yo sé que contigo me portaba muy mal
Pero nunca imagine que llegaría el final
Sabe' que quiero tenerte a mi lado
Se que también a mí ya estás acostumbrado
Olvida los errores del pasado
I should've been there right next to youEmbed

Your bottom big, like trailer
My money big, like whale o
It’s very long, like vuvuzela
It’s very strong to cure your pain o

Hello my name is Davido
Where are you from I want to know
Is it the East or West side
Anywhere you talk I want to go
Anything you want I will give you o
Even if it’s still around this globe
Cause I have been around the world
And I've seen a lot of girls
Tanzania, Morocco, Liberia, and Ghana
South Africa, Nigeria, Botswana, Mozambique

Ooh girl you want to party (ooh yeah)
Like the people out in Malawi
Dancing makossa in Congo (oya)
Or in Ghana dancing Azonto

Hello my name is Davido
Where are you from I want to know
Is it the East or West side
Anywhere you talk I want to go
Anything you want I will give you o
Even if it’s still around this globe
Cause I have been around the world
And I've seen a lot of girls
Tanzania, Morocco, Liberia, and Ghana

Left the club because we're drunk already
Left your car but you'll come back and get it
If she did it then she don't regret it
Five gold chains, and now they think I'm sellin'

I just ran it up for my people's sake
I just fucked that bitch on a birthday cake
Fuck me fifty times, this some
Told her I ain't play no games, ain't no Playstation
My dreads gettin' long and my niggas Haitian
I gave that bitch a bone just to penetrate
Baby I ain't never home, man I'm overseas
No US dollars, I got chrome faces
Pop a bean, get you eat out
Chains on my neck stand and they stay out
Every time she wanna fuck she come say, "may I?"
And call me mister if you want this payout

Sleepless Nights Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Orejebu)
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

Nights like this make me wish I never fell in love with you
Time flies by, I text, get no reply, get no reply from you (No, no)
You just keep playin' games, things ain't the same for me and you, tell me why
You were my all, but I'm no longer scared, scared of losin' you (Hm-hm, hm-hm, oh no)
Colors of the sky used to be blue, but now they changin' hue
Quick to say I'm wrong, but you're so slow to see it from my view
Love shine like thе sun, then disappear just like thе mornin' dew
You want loyalty, but you can't have your cake and eat it, too, you know? No

Sleepless nights when you're not around
Who do you fuck when I'm not in town?
My mind is racin', I need to slow down, woah, no (Oh)
Sleepless nights when you're not around
Who do you fuck when I'm not in town?
My mind is racin', I need to slow down

What you not gon' do
When you downtown, out all night?
I don't call you tired
But you downtown, out all night (Orejebu)
I don't call you tired
But you downtown, out all night
Downtown, out all night

You dey online, but you no dey reply
Too many things goin' through my mind
Got me fucked up, you no dey try
Callin' your phone, why you no dey pick up, yeah?
That's when she come and apologize
Don't wanna see you with another guy
You no dey fuck? Look me in the eyes
Mi ah no dey fire, I hope you realize (Oh, oh)
Times like these, they make me feel like seh
I've been there wastin' my time (My time)
Not gon' sleep, I just take up my breath
That's 'cause I can't stop thinkin' of you (Oh-oh, oh-oh, hey)

You just keep playin' games, things ain't the same for me and you, tell me why (Oh no)
You were my all, but I'm no longer scared, scared of losin' you
(Oh no, no, no-no)

Is it time for give it up now?
Was it love or was it lust now?
Tell me who the fuck I'm 'posed to trust now?
Gyal shine like bust down
Girl why let me down?
Come wine on me now, now
There was a time I thought we'd make it through
You want loyalty, but you can't have your cake and eat it too, you know? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sleepless nights when you're not around
Who do you fuck when I'm not in town?

Everything I do is wrong
Let you tell it but you can't tell me nothin' I'm wrong
I handle my business the right way, I'm on
Now people can't even hit me on my phone
You're just too crazy, I know I'm not wrong

If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said

Never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know
Oh yeah oh yeah

See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the soundEmbed

Too Good To You Lyrics


Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey

Holà chica, hey
Sors de mon crâne et tombe dans mon cœur
Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey
Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey
Holà chica, hey
Sors de mon crâne et tombe dans mon cœur
Dans ma tête y’a que nous deux dans le scénario
Une histoire de love écrite en argot
Les autres meufs balance-les dans la fosse
Dans mon coeur t'es comme à Guantanamo
Quelques verres, on dirait que des kassos
Ouais, des distractions y'en a trop
Pas de stress dit la louve entourée agneaux
Biatchs de merde n'ont pas les ratios
On fonce dans le mur, les freins ont té-sau
Modèle S en guise de chariot
Sors le roquette, la lune s'attrape pas au lasso
Donc comman-comman-commando
Vas-y, tu peux me suivre sans t'abonner
Tu peux t'approcher sans t'accrocher
Sur le riddim de Dany, pas meilleure collabo' qu'Shay et Davido

Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey
Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey

Sors de mon crâne et tombe dans mon cœur
Ouvre ton p'tit cœur, hey

But girl you do me like kryptonite

When you wine it on me, girl

I can't be with you 'cause I got a girl, I'm datin'
When you wine it on me, girl

Hunnid chains on my neck, feel like Rick the Ruler
All yellow gold like Mansa Musa
Iced out bezel cooler than a cooler
It's just me and my bitch shootin' with a shooter
Let me tell you 'bout this mama out from Brooklyn
Shawty say she like how I'm lookin'
Shawty said I look like a snack
And if I ever had home cookin' (Home cook')
And I'm like "Fuck that"
You ever had a nigga that's Wooin' (Woo)

VIP Lyrics
Die Zeit sie verfliegt, schnell wie auf Speed

Bitte mach' mir nicht auf Pablo, Habib
Salam Deutschrap, du Piç
Jetzt ist Nate da, alle Weiber twerken auf den Beat
C'est la vie, ihr hört mich lachen, ich bin real
Ich verdiene viel, check' mein Instagramprofil
Doch von nix kommt nix und bestimmt keine Klicks (bra)
Du bist so faul, deine Clips sind ein Witz (ja)
Ich erinnere mich, warst ein Bruder für mich (nein)
Im Nachhinein schäme ich mich wirklich für dich (haha, ja man)
Du hast deine Chance verpennt (bye-bye-bye)
Sitze bald im Benz
Du düst weiter, Bus, 30 km/h
Hab' gesagt: „Verpiss dich grad“, komme seit dem wieder klar
Nach den off'nen Sachen, Mama gibt es keine Briefe mehr
Einbruch, Drogenhandel, Kings of  (ja)
Hab' noch nie gezögert, Bratan, wenn's um meine Mama ging
Beleidigung, die Konsequenzen: Schüsse fallen, *ding-ding-ding*
Die Zeit sie verfliegt, schnell wie auf Speed

Hello and goodbye is the game we play
But I just won't play by those rules
Baby, I'm not lost
Ima keep it one hundred till you’re what I want
Till there be no surprises about what page I'm on
I think that there's no mistaking
I hear what your body's saying
Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…
So come on just let go
Right here in this moment
I want what you want now. (x2)

I want what you want (x5)

Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion
Wonderful baby kill it with what you gossy
I want what you want now

People dance
Right round their feelings won't take a chance
That somehow somebody would feel them back
But I know you’re feeling me too
Baby let's not care
If there’s tomorrow or whether there is a future here
From our day one, I knew there was one thing clear
I think there is no mistake in
I hear what your body saying
You might also like
Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…
So come on just let go
Right here in this moment
I want what you want now. (x2)

I want what you want (x10)

Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion
Wonderful baby kill it with what you gossy
I want what you want now

Let's not care
If there’s tomorrow or whether there is a future here

Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…

Zoom (Remix) Lyrics
When they tryna hold me I go zoom zoom zoom
Don’t like your vibe and I go zoom zoom zoom
Blowing up the roof and E go boom boom boom
Don’t you ever treat me like I be mumu
Bad energy I zoom zoom zoom
I've been on my way like I be coming soon
Got a chaperone and e go boom boom boom
So when they tryna hold me I go zoom zoom zoom

Yeah, now tell me why I no go zoom
Me and money talking tell me why you in the room
You gon need a ladder just to speak to me
Nigga u are talking to the fucking highest in the room
I never cap, never stuttеr
Never stress, don’t bothеr
Put a Lambo in the crib
Y’all should call me big brother
Burberry on my sock
Steph Curry shoot my shot
And you know the nigga high
And you know the nigga high
Congratulations that’s the only valid conversation
See they love me now in the whole world
I’m the special one for the occasion

When they tryna hold me I go zoom zoom zoom
Don’t like your vibe and I go zoom zoom zoom
Blowing up the roof and E go boom boom boom
Don’t you ever treat me like I be mumu
Bad energy I zoom zoom zoom
I've been on my way like I be coming soon
Got a chaperone and e go boom boom boom
So when they tryna hold me I go zoom zoom zoom

They hate what they made us yeah
I prayed for the baby yeah
Smoking till everything numb yeah
Do you know what this pain is
I go zoom zoom zoom
I go skrrrt, skrrrt, skrrrt
I don’t care who sue
Cause I’m gon strike first
Niggas hate what they ion know
Throw me shade and I absolve
Don’t give me favour ion need
Don’t give me thinks ion want
Get in my mind right
You trying to be god like
Somebody can fire on you
If I’m having a little ice
Having an iPhone, I’m having some nappy hair
I’m happy that I’m you hotter
I’m happy somebody here yeah
Congratulations that’s the only valid conversation
No amount of money gon’ change us
Cause I don’t care for silence since day one, yeah
Yeah, Wale
