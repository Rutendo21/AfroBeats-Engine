24 (Interlude) Lyrics24 years and nothing don change
Some old house In the same old same place
I dey see am for your eyes
E dey your eyes
You don't feel alive
There's no more life
I wish I could feel your pain
But lai lai e no fit to be the same
Memories never dies
They never die
You don't feel alive
(I don't feel alive)
You are such a fool
Why you go do this all for love
Nothing wey I fit do
The damage has been done
How many more years before you realize
People don change
The love no dey lie
But you go dey okay
You go dey alright
If not today then tomorrow night
Whatever you do
Just know that I love you
And you go dey okay
You go dey alrightYou might also likeEmbed
 
 
Adore Lyrics
First things first
Quench this thirst
Let me burst and take the first verse
Let's rehearse and play the next parts
I know it hurts to say the last words
Give me a minute, only a minute
Tell me a secret, tell me to keep it
Open the 'rrari baby I promise I'm ready
But I cannot carry you if your heart is still heavy
Love of my life, one of a kind
This kind thing no dey come overnight
All of my guys don dey call am "our wife"
All of my life I've been unorganized
No more apologies, I'll make you proud of me
I'll give you all of my life, I'll give you all of me
Nowhere I'd rather be, I want you next to me
I've seen the girl of my dreams, she's right in front of me
I remember all the things you've done
I remember when you left me darling
Tell me, tell me what's the memories for?
I'ma leave it, I'ma watch it burn
I remember when I watched you run
Ran away and you left me darling
But I lied to you
I can't stand there and watch it burn

Cause I can't get you off my mind
And I still adore you (Oh oh hmm)
And I can't lie, can't deny
That I still adore you (Still)

Eh eh eh
You could see I'm going crazy
In and out of love in this lifestyle baby
I wanna see you iced out baby
It's one of those nights, turn the lights down baby
Even if I tell you that I don't
What I say ain't matching what I show
Wishing time go slow
One can only hope so
Make me so para when you go ghost tho', yeah
These melodies playing in my head
La da di da di, I can't go to bed
So far away from somebody so close
You say the least and be doing the most
Violets are blue and these roses are red
I should be burning this flowers instead
Why did you leave?
Where did you go?
Are you okay ?
I wanna know

Change Lyrics
My life dey make more sense as I get older
Wake up in the morning, do some Yoga
Now I'm number one, I'm going global
And I no go stop until it's over
You see my cup runneth over
Na why you no fit ever see me sober
If life na war, then I be soldier
I'm fighting on until it's over

See my life's about to change (Change)
But I feel some type of way
Everyone around me keeps asking me the same
Are you ready for the pain?
'Cause your life's about to change
Ou ou ou
Ou ou ou
Ou ou ou
My lifе's about to change
(Yo eskeez kill the rhythm and buss it)

Stеpping in the room and I gat everybody smiling
Don't know if they like me for my person or my talent
Most time I feel like I be suffering but I'm silent
It's gonna hard to deal with pressure but I'm trying
Different women in my DMs, it's a challenge
E no go cost me anything to reply them
But blame it on the game, my guy it made me savage
Kinda made my feelings fly away
Comment tu t'appelle?
Dia on my neck (Oh)
Pull up in my range or we pull up in my Benz
Whole lot of bitches and a whole lot of friends
Whole lot of struggles now makes whole lot of sense
Sex and Cannabis
Tryna find my peace
I can never miss
I got friends and enemies
And a whole lotta geez
Praying not to see me fall
I've been on the high road and I've seen it all

Frozen (Fireboy DML Remix) Lyrics
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm, we'd never be apart (Sick)
Wahala go dey to ba lo
Plenty wahala go dey to ba lo
You dey make me dey wait for your love
Go on my knees and I pray to the Lord
After all, you have taken it all
Everything I've got, you have taken it all
Baby I've been there for so long
Now you say you don't want this no more
I've been waiting, waiting for a sign
You delayed me, playing, wasting time
Don't make me wait in line
Don't make me waste my time
I've been waiting all my life
And I thought you
I thought you loved me
I thought you chose me
I tried to take care of your heart, but it's frozen
Why can't you show me, don't leave me open
I thought you told me, that you're ready, but you're broken

Mmm (Oh yeah), if I could melt your heart (If I, if I)
Mmm (O-oh yeah), we'd never be apart (Apart)
Mmm (Oh, yeah), if I could melt your heart (If I, if I)

Go Away Lyrics
What can I do to make it go away?
I don't like this feeling
And what should I do if you don't feel the same?
I'm losing patience
And it doesn't make sense
It needs to go away

I don't like this feeling
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye, ye ye
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye
How did I fall in the first place
You too bad, you dey burst brain
I no fit lie at all, I can't lie
You make me feel good in the worst way
I'm so sentimental I know
So many plenty girls that I know
But I still feel the same
I don't like this feeling

What can I do to make it go away?
I don't like this feeling
And what should I do if you don't feel the same?
I'm losing patience
And it doesn't make sense
It needs to go away
I don't like this feeling
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye, ye ye
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye

Hard guy but I'm catching feelings
That's why I've been hiding it since
What have I done? what could it be?
I don't like the way you been fucking with me
I'm losing my control
Can't put these thoughts on hold

God Only Knows Lyrics
For a while I've been thinking
Why did I ever push you away
My eyes to the ceiling praying to God to bring you my way
What the hell was I thinking
I don't think I was thinking
It's all messed up inside of my head
It's all messed up inside of my head

God only knows
If I'll ever see you again
God only knows
If you still know my name
God only knows
Heaven only knows
God only knows
If I'll ever see you again
God only knows (God only knows)
If you could just give me one more chance
I promise I'll be a better man
Girl I know say I don fall your hand
Many times but you still understand
For my mind, for my mind
I been think say I get time
All messed up inside of my head
It's all mеssed up inside of my head

God only knows
If I'll ever see you again

If you still know my name

Havin’ Fun Lyrics
Demons knocking on my door
But I no fit open up
And me I no fit sell my soul
Me no dey stress anymore
Cause I'm blessed and I’m young
And the blessings come from God
So me get down on the floor
Say a prayer to my father say a prayer to my Lord
Nothing in this life is sure
So me get up on the road
And me live life my way yay
7am and the sun is shining
And then I hear my song pon the radio
With a caribbean girl beside me
I don't need to talk, you already know
I'm just having fun
I’m just having fun
Oh oh oh oh
I'm just having fun
I'm just having fun
Oh oh oh oh

Wake up, roll one jay for the morning
Good vibes all my guys link up
Therе's no time and life is short
So I live my lifе and I seize every moment
One of my girlfriend's calling
Don't think I might pick up
Lowkey I might be drunk
Spending time and spending money
Big ups to my guys, my family
Big ups to my girls, they love me
Big ups to my friends and foes and my day
Ones who never gave up on me
Pull up in the range, wassup
Turn up at the club, let's go!
Let's celebrate tonight
And have some fun
Cause when tomorrow comes

They tie gele, they tie bandana
They wanna lock me up, turn me to mandela

That bitch gon' fuck me cause I'm 
Same bitch 
If I go to jail right now, the bitch'll get ghost, had to cut off
Cause she love to do the most
Had to cut her off, switch to a different lane
Married to the money, I'm commited to the game

New York City Girl Lyrics
Fine girl from New York City
I don't mind if you give me chance
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time
Runaway with me
I don't care if you got a man
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time

She just came into town last month
And she won't be around that long
I just wanna have a good time
Maybe once maybe two times
She got the prettiest smile
And she got the wittiest mind
Say before you catch that flight
Can I have a wickedest whine
Fine girl from New York City
I don't mind if you give me chance
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time
Runaway with me
I don't care if you got a man
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time

She makes me sing
She always got me acting out
She's like the wind
She's just a traveler passing by
Maybe in another life
This feelings won't die
Before you catch that flight
Can I have a kiss one time

Fine girl from New York City
I don't mind if you give me chance
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time
Runaway with me
I don't care if you got a man
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time
Fine girl from New York City
I don't mind if you give me chance
Can I have just one more dance
Before you leave for the summer time
Runaway with me

Remember me tin ba ti lo

Of the mountains I have climbed
Travelled between space and time
Tell them my story my struggles and my glory
Don't leave anything behind (Remember me)
Tell them of the songs I sang
That I was not a lonely man
Tell them that I lived my life with kindness in my eyes and love inside my heart
And I hope they will
Remember me tin ba ti lo (Ba ti lo)

One day when it is your time
You will leave this world behind
All the things you said and did
Will be your legacy
Ooh ohh
For you see, life is like a song
It doesn't just go on and on
There is an end to everything
So as you dance and as you sing
Make the most of the melodies
And I hope they will

Running Lyrics
Ladipoe, Fireboy and Vibez man
Here's another story from a bad man
Vibez
But you knew that

There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
Even though the country don dey tire me
I dey catch cruise, Eko Miami
If only bad news could be bribed, take all my money
I like my lies sweet, tastes like irony
But that's the reason, I dey vеx my nigga
Heavy is the head but forgеt my nigga
Crown don dey bend from the stress my nigga
It's getting hard to suppress my liquor
So I'm drinking more wine at four thirty
I'd rather be online than out with company
Man I'm tryna numb my mind, the thoughts are too heavy
'Cause life is no joke we cope with comedy
I really no dey see your face
That's why we switch lanes, no dey indicate
Everybody wan blow, who dey pick the date?
God when will I be the one that they imitate
But most times I feel no one can relate

When there's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes

Afrobeats or na kpangolo
I took that shit international
Ain't leaving until it's time to go
Galloping like I'm an antelope
Ou ha
I took it personal
Lone soldier me I dey stand alone
Me I dey fight for my envelope
But me I no fit to dey fight alone
Ou ha

And you don't have to bro
What's a vaccine to an antidote
Blood, sweat, tears in my engine o
If you smell success that's my cologne
Broke almost every code
Still I got fans filling every row
This anointing from the microphone
And that's on God, only heaven knows

There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
There's no time, there's no energy
I'm just running, running, running
Sweet white wine 'cause there's no Hennessy
I'm just running, running on vibes
I've been running for life
Pastor said I've been running from life
Tank on E I'm just running on vibes
Sweet white wine with some Henny combined
Let me unwind
Coz it's heavy all night
I don't want any on mine
You can unfriend me online
I'm just running, running running on vibes
Yeah, but you knew that
It's LadipoeEmbed

Away away

I just realised
When I come around
And when they play the sound
I just feel alive
I’m not just a singer wey dey give the ginger
I give you the vibe
The sound of the guitar sweet pass shitor

And when you give me the rhythm and bass chai!

When I hear the sound

I don't want to die
I just want to dance to the riddim and bounce
Maybe one more time
I just want the girls to dey dance and whine
As we shack palm wine
Can you feel the bounce
Oya mami go down to the down down down (to the down down down)
I dey see the ileke on your waist chai

As soon as I step on stage everybody start to dey scream my name
Joy that I can't explain

I guess I'm not that strong, uh
My whole body leaner closer to you lately
Even though I know it's wrong
I just give into
The shape of your body, replays in my mind
The sound of your promises, echo in me deep inside
Crave your attention, it compliments my pride
All fired up, with nowhere to go

(Just give me)
You give me temptation
Oh that temptation, no-no, no
That's all I see when I look at you
Temptation (Ooh temptation), temptation (Ooh that temptation)
That's all I see when I look at you (All I see, see, see)
