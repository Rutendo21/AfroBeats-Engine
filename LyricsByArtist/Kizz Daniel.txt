Burn Lyrics
When I'm fifty sometin sometin
I'll still call you my baby girl
And I don't want no body
But only you my bae
When I'm fifty sometin sometin
I'll still call you my honey pie
And I don't want nobody
But only you my bae

You make me burn like fire fire
Burn like fire
You make me shine like diamond diamond
Up in the sky
You make me run like bolt, Usain bolt
When I run back to you
You make me doubt myself
You make me doubt
You make me doubt myself
You make me lose my mind
Am I enough for you
Or am I just passing by you
Girl I got cool when I met you
I got rich when you moved in
Girl you brought blessings to me
Wait

I am the car and you are the engine
I am the oooo you are the oooweee
I am the nerd you are the cool kid
If you we live again oh girl
I'll be looking out for you you
And when I get you, I'll promise you again

When I'm fifty sometin sometin
I'll still call you my baby girl
And I don't want no body
But only you my bae
When I'm fifty sometin sometin
I'll still call you my honey pie
And I don't want nobody
But only you my bae

I say bad man dapper than them
That's the reason them vex
That's the reason them block my way
The reason them sketchy
Bad man sharper than them
That's the reason i pray
That's the reason i up my game
The reason i play safe

We're making milli-billi ya
Follow the baba
Far do ain't new to this
Started from the ghetto zero to hero
We killed them all finally, baba
Wan lo ti shey e'mi fado the prodigy
I can't shout, can't kill a man
I can take another brother Girl straight to bed
Me freaky
Welcome to sin city
I say, Kiku ma pa mother mi
I say, Kiku ma pa father mi

I say they can't believe that
I smoke no Kush
That I'm the one them choose
Not that other guys ain't cool but
Cool push me and I cool
Who push them?
Finally, if i don't see past them
I no know them but still fams them
Poku l'owo mi and i still dash them
Bad boy team, nobody die
Ka lo l'olumo ka lo mu tonic & gin
Hills don't scare me, tonic & gin

Skin Lyrics
Your looks don't matter
Is what you do that counts
And your lips don't matter
Is what you say that counts
Let the whole world know
When you look at me
See me for me
And not the color of my skin

I got a really dark skin and I like it like that
A really white skin and I like it like that
Everybody know
I'm in my own zone
I'm a king I'm a queen cuz I say so
Tell the barman put a liquor more
Tell my mama I'll be gone for so long
Everywhere I go, I'll surely come home some day
I wanna see the rest of the world
Wayo wayo wayo
All alone, in a cold cold world
Singing kumbaya on the mountain top and getting freaky freaky freaky freaky frеaky

Your looks don't matter
Is what you do that counts
And your lips don't matter
Is what you say that counts
Let thе whole world know
When you look at me
See me for me
And not the color of my skin

I pray that I wake up one day
And there ain't war outside
And on the tv all I see
Yeah that's homicide
They tryna pit you against me
Conquer and divide
Don't believe everything I read
When I scroll online

Skin skin
Black or white
Brown or red
All of dem nice
Shine bright like the star
Shoot like one
And I've got all the power in me
Life is such a beautiful thing
I wanna live on forever
Make nobody hold me back
This is my life and I owe it to jah to be awesome
