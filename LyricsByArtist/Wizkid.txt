Aan Je Zitten Lyrics

Ik wil effe aan je zitten, naast je liggen
De hele nacht met jou
Kan je effe aan me zitten en naast me liggen
Zeg me, ben je down?
Schatje, ik kijk naar je lippen en naar je billen
Echt, je maakt me lauw
Dus kan ik effe aan je zitten en naast je liggen
De hele nacht met jou
Vraag het me, schatje, ik geef het
Hou het echt met je, schatje, ik meen het
Jij weet wat ik doe, jij weet het
Alles wat ik wil, zij heeft het
Alles wat je wilt, jij krijgt het
Misschien maken we een kleine
Echt, je hoeft je niet meer te bewijzen
M'n nummer één, jij blijft het

Ik wil effe aan je zitten, naast je liggen

De hele nacht met jou

Baby girl, she love me like a reggaeton
Said she loves my songs, so she sing along
Said you gotta dip, don't you come along?
Hold me, oh, your booty turn me on
I wait on the dance that you owe me, owe me
Keep your body close all night darling, darling
I will never leave you, keep it burning, burning

Bella Lyrics

Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Yaï

Elle habite dans ma ville, quand elle me croise, elle me ves-qui
Cinq ans qu'j'la vois dans mon bâtiment : c'est ma voisine
J'connais ses frères, c'est mes gars sûrs, même plus grands qu'moi
Quand elle me voit, un petit sourire et elle s'en va
Bref, on a jamais tapé la discut' : elle m'ignore grave
La go m'intrigue mais si j'lui parle, j'suis dans d'beaux draps
À croire que je n'en vaux pas la peine
J'devrais pas, mais j'avoue, j'ai la haine
En fait, elle m'attire, comment lui dire ?
Une histoire d'amour peut attirer ennuis
Hé, ma bella, hé
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Mon cœur va cher-lâ pour toi, ma bella
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Hé, ma bella, hé
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Donne-moi un sourire, un regard ou un petit câlin
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe

Seen a lot of girls in my life, now I’ve seen you, I can't move on
You wind up that waist, making me dance, now, I can't move on
Oh, my girl, so sexy
The way she dance, so sexy
So, she give me love, sexy
You’re making me want more, sexy girl
With your sexy body, come and chop my money, yo
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Oya take all my money, put am for your head, hey
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Make we manya dey manya dey go, baby guess so
Aïe, aïe, aïe, aïe
Make you follow me go, make you chop all my money

Blessed Lyrics
Cold mineral, cold pure water

Woah Woah

I might be rough around the edges, maybe yes
I keep it nappy and I do what make me happy
And nobody can deny me that I'm blessed
I might be rough around the edges, maybe yes
I keep it nappy and I do what make me happy
And nobody can deny me that I'm blessed
Self preservation, self elevation
These kind of things they deserve celebration
No hesitation, no reservation
Go for the big leagues, no relegation
Let's celebrate life
Kick back and take five
And give thanks to the source that create life
To see a sun set or see a sun rise
And see my son born with these same eyes
To see my son smile, brighten every grey sky
He's growing so fast, that's why everyday I give it one hundred, nuh stop at 90
Praise the Almighty, the Father anoint me

Say tonight man feeling blessed o

Blown Away Lyrics
My God, you blew my mind
And you killing me slowly with the things you say, ah

Whirlwind but I'm in the same place and
Wear my heart up on your sleeve so you could never
Go away

Blown away by your smile
It knocks me right off my feet
And every time you walk by

Don't pretend you don't want me 'cause

Boom Lyrics
Baby got ass like a trunk
Took her from her man, he a punk
She got a body like Baywatch
I met her at the Playhouse
Ten bottles, bought ten more
Told her move her ass to the tempo
Is you really with the shit, though?
Really, is you really with the shit, though?
We got champagne and vodka
Goons with me if they need a problem
Fuck niggas, hate real niggas, get money
All muhfucking day
Baby drop it to the ground like yass, bitch
Back it up like yass, bitch
After the club, I'll smash it
We don't cuff hoes, we pass it
Girl, please, please, baby, don't leave
You got that booty, booty boom bam ba
Baby give me that boom bam ba
Baby girl, please, please, baby, don't leave

TranslationsFrançaisPortuguêsEspañolBorrowed Love Lyrics
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears
It's just hope, you gon' end up feelin' sorrow

Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom
She wetter than a river
Body say so much, she got me off the bottle
I'm finally freed up
She freaky as fuck, I leave, she gon' follow
She gave me a sign
My fingers on her panty line
Rollin' up a dandelion
Took a sec' just to catch the vibe
Second guessin', that's something I never wanna do
Crack under pressure, that's something I'm never gonna do

Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom

Baby girl, just turn off the light, turn off the light
Baby, show me love, baby, turn off the light
Baby, ease my stress, baby, turn off the light
Baby, back it up, don't turn up the fight
Turn off the light, my girl, say you're fine
I need that energy, I need that energy tonight
Gyal, keep it cold and bun up the vibe
Say, me no gon' live tonight, girl turn up the vibe
Say, me no gwaan fight every day
Love it when we play, love it when we, yeah, yeah

Burning Down Lyrics
You and me, we've grown together
Grew up in the same town
Used to kick it on the roads together
Till the new breed harboured around
And then you call my name
And tell me all the ways that I could drive a man insane
But it won't stop, my tears drop
Cause I love you

You take a woman 
Control me, I'm paralyzed
And there's no escape from your sight
Is this right? Is this right?
Cause we're burning down, and I won't be to blame
So go call the fire brigade, cause I don't want all this on my name
Yeah, we're burning, burning, burning, burning down
Yeah, we're burning, burning, burning, burning down

Sick and tired of the stories all filled with glory
The ties of wherever that he goes
And now all that is left are his lies and deception
It captures the heart of the people
And no, me never love a man who manipulates like that
And no, me never love a man who manipulates like that



So babygirl, I know the things I've done to you will make you leave me one day
So babygirl, I know the things I've done to you will make you leave me some day
And if you ever change your mind, babygirl I will be here for you
Cause I feel low, I still feel real low
So babygirl, we used to run the town, but now you wanna burn it down
I know I told you I would hold you down, so my baby, don't burn it down
I wanna take away the frown, change my ways and hold you down
Please let me bring back your smile, oh, my baby, don't burn it down

Change LyricsNaija, Naija
It’s time to make a change
Our people dey die, Government wake up
Our children dey cry, Papa God help us
Our leaders dey lie, Naija stand up
Cos it’s gonna make a change
New year,same story
New regime, no glory
More promises, more lies
Naija we no try
From no light to bad roads
From armed robbers to bokoharam
Instead of going higher
We go from frying pan to fire
We must rise and take a stand
We must heal our father land
Wе need peace and unity
It’s up to you and me
Wе must vote, na the way
Peaceful protest as we pray
Till they do just what we say
Till Naija begins to change
Wonder(x4)
The things we facing makes me wonder
How I still make it through
How we still make it through
It’s the same thing since I was a kid
They’ll be getting all the honors for the things they never did
They never think of the future, all they think about is greed
No plan for us to succeed
Arise o compatriots
Nigerians who are called to obey
Made to suffer in shame
We must vote na the way
Peaceful protest as we pray
Till they do just what dey say
Till Naija begins to change
When I see my people they die
Na this kind thing they make me sad o
Small pikin them they cry
Them no fit chop this life too hard o
Bad man try to revive
All my people we must unite
Stand together and fight for your right
Till we soar unto greater heights
Shay be na love, peace and unity
Be the only criteria
No matter where you are from
We are all part of one Nigeria
We must vote na the way
Peaceful protest as we pray
Till they do just what dey say
Till Naija begins to change
People, try to dey cooperate
With your fellow brother make you tolerate
Join hands together make we elevate

And inna the club my music is ever blazing

Ease Your Mind Lyrics
Many thing don really open my eyes
Many things don happen wey don open my mind

Never let the small talks but the money get to me

Some days, it fit be lie sey your rain no pour
Hear my brother, even if it be like days too long
Even if it be like sey your light no come

And I pour some more ice, it made me colder
See the music take me places

Wey dey make the girls and ladies dem dey love up on me
See starboy dey here, where the men dey here?
And the kele and the girls, all of them dey here

Eme Boyz Lyrics

We be killing every show
We get the girls dancing on the floor
We no go stop we go dey carry go
'Cause they love that E.M.E. boys
See me now I dey run the show
From Monday to Sunday you should know
We no go stop we go dey carry go
Cuz they love that E.M.E. boys
E.M.E. soldier, young K the king
Takin' no chance we dey rap we dey sing
So called rappers, they don’t mean a thing
You can turn out the lights, and we still gone bling
Its commercial I’m selling it
Every story that I got, I’m tellin' it
Sometimes haters hate when I elevate
I’m known not to give a fuck, I’m celibate
I feel like I can't tell a lie
"I’m the truth and excellence" is all that I testify
And every show that I’m at is electrified
Long as you let me drive, you’ll enjoy the ride
Triple threat, triple treat
Gettin' money every single day of the week
Say you want beef, but all you do is tweet
These rappers are all chickens, all we do is eat

We be killing every show
We get the girls dancing on the floor
We no go stop we go dey carry go
'Cause they love that E.M.E. boys
See me now I dey run the show

Giving your girlfriend everything she wanting
You call me Banky, she call me Mr. strong thing
Making more bucks Ghana mo sor

This is God’s plan, man, why you vexing for me?
You’re a little bit of noise be a riot
You just a weather change with a climax
Got you hating on the position that I’m in

Energy (Stay Far Away) Lyrics
Greaze
True, ayy

I'm tryna get paid, take money, cash cheques
You see the set, that's Lash, that's Dex
Young C, Young Shorty, Makaveli
White bricks, True Religion, on the telly, it's me
Wiz got the house full of freaks
That's why I haven't been around for a week
I'm getting pounds in my sleep
I'm at the top of the mountain, it's peak
Bring it back before the villain
I had a life, real talk, True Religion
It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching
Walked in, no weapon, made a killing
Tongue kissing pretty women
New iPhone 'cause I'm done with all the bitching
Tryna be in my position
Keep my shades on 'cause they tryna see the vision
She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make it stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time

Breakfast in bed on a plane
I could never complain
I was walking with the limp, had the cane
Dex said greatness and nothing was the same
Now we're set for life
I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice
You heard I'm in the club, then my best advice
Is put your shoes on and come and get your wife
'Cause we've been having sex just for exercise
Every night, man are doing sexercise
She looks into my eyes, now she's mesmerised

She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time

Ayy, they better get used to the flex
African man, you see the jewels on my neck
Black James Bond, that's the new silhouette
You see me in the street and I was moving correct
Been running around, tryna do the home run
Left that girl, she was no fun
I tie one, smoke one
Big chief Skeppy and I answer to no one
Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special
Bird's eye view, SK level
Give them the Shaku when I dance with the devil
Young Fela Kuti, the return of the rebel
I told her I need some space
Real busy body, never stay in one place
And she knows I've got more tricks under my sleeve
That's why she never wants me to leave
You might also like
She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time7Embed

Exodus make move, everybody move "One time, one time so"
Everybody move ... 				 "You can't take my shine"

Please, go get it; please, without excuse
Winners have a plan, losers just wanna lose
Against the odds, I'm here, it's what I choose
I've been high, way before substance abuse
When ma uncle got sick, I visited the clinic
They had killed him physique, but never killed the spirit
He look me in the eye, and I started to cry
But I determined to be strong, life is just a midget
Who is a hater? Who's a fvcking critic?
Music ease the pain, pain in every lyric
So when you make it rain, we be making visit
Back to the hood, help them with some figures
Now it's up to them, figure out what they wanna
You kept to your choices, I believe in Karma
I’m a black star, I'm from Tema, Ghana
And I love Wale, shoutouts to Bandana

Exodus made move, everybody move

She said call me a hustler
You can be my customer. When
I'm in an X5 there nobody can question ya
Dolci and Gabbana, Cuba as fine as cigar
You need naira, you need dollar 2009 Impala
Pop your collar, wear your zara designer
There's no more drama. I want with
Big boys, Daniel to Barrack Obama
Yaradua, Goodluck. See I want
The presido, Mike Adenuga types
I need a man to make me glow
She said I like Jim Iyke but Dangote is better yet
I like first class seats but I prefer a private jet
And I don't need a dude who's bank
Account is very large
I want the man who owns the bank
The head nigga in charge
I'm into tycoons, CEOs very rich
I'm a high brand chic, I'm an Island chic
How I cruise, see the swag, Jimi shoes
Felly bag. I'm an oil rig chic not a Mr. Biggs chic
If you don't talk money, omo don't show up
If you don't drive cars, omo don't show up
Cause she's all about the money
She's all about the money
Cause she's all about the money
She's all about the money

She's an aristo girl, she's a cristos girl
She's making those connects like a Sisqo girl
She cops what she sees, lot of stops overseas
She's an arts for extreme
She shops for a week
She's VIP, don't need I.V, just C.I.D
She's V.I.G. Paparazzi wanna see her
The girls wanna be her
She's a star cos she's got
(Fast money, fast cars)
Mama use to tell her all you've got is pride
Ashawo na Ashawo, no matter what you drive
Don't spend your life to buy money
Cos you can't spend money to buy life
Mama use to say baby you are who you are
No matter how fast your money or your car
Don't spend your life to buy money
Cos you can't spend money to buy life

If you don't talk money, omo don't show up
If you don't drive cars, omo don't show up

Forever (Unforgettable Demo) Lyrics
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
You don't gotta search hard to find me
With the money is where I'll be
With the cash, yeah, that's where I'll be
Give it up, baby, no stopping
My gyal, you bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever, oh yeah
My gyal, you bad, you bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever, oh yeah

Would you leave with me tonight?
Get high, get fucked with me tonight?
I don't want this thing for life
My gyal come rock with me tonight

I can provide the good vibe
I keep a hot one by my side
And if you choose then you better chose wisely
Me not coming in clutch is unlikely
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing
Girl, what you got for me?
What you got for me?
I love you long time, that's a guarantee
I switch time zones just to come see
I got your mind blown, yeah, easy
Don't want to fall, just want to taste
Tell me yes, don't reply maybe
Why we gotta do so much talking?
I'm tryna make it through the crowd, baby
You might also like
You bad, you bad
But mi no want this forever, forever

You know what your body wants to do
Why you gotta think this through (ooh yeah)
You fucking with the midnight crew
Playing your favorite tunes
You tryna find that feel from way back when
I'm speeding with the roof caved in
You can say that somebody's out to get ya
I'm for real, ain't nobody filthy richer
Give me that look one more time, baby
Yeah, It's over
I got the Colorado pack, it's over
Yeah, yeah
I make time for what I want
Meet me back at the room
Since you're in the mood
You're gonna hurt somebody
The way you move your waist you're gonna hurt somebody
You don't owe nobody nothing...

Drug me
I'm smoking, blowing Os, and feeling stars
Getting so high off my supply
I do it so easy, I don't try
Can't you see yourself with me tonight?
I don't want to hurt you, fuss, and fight
I'm gon' do you make you close your eyes
All in favor, please say, "Aye"
Call your job and tell them you'll be late3Embed

Two or three gyals not enough for me
Give me, give me more, not enough for me

Even it feels like quickly everywhere is for you

And we're spiritually connecting along too
That's why I have to check you like my mic (1-2, 1-2)

And show you how it feels on the winning side
I—I—It costs to be the boss, but I’ll pay the price
Tonight, I wanna groom you like a bride
Just like a brain, you’re all that's in my head, oh
I—I—I—I brought enough booze to quench your thirst, but first

I wanna see you get down tonight, eh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna see you get down tonight, eh

I wanna see you move your body tonight, eh

G Love Lyrics
Ciroc with the ice
Live life, never worry 'bout the price
Thick thighs, I can see it in your eyes, yeah
She just want that ghetto love
Yeah, gyal so hood, mi nuh lie
Never let another man try
Pull up on my gyal, it’s that time, yeah
She just want that ghetto love

We ain't even got to the yard yet
With a African girl that you can't get
My old ting saw me lipsing my new ting
Luckily I got a calm ex (A calm one)
All her friends think I'm nice and sweet (Sweet one)
Is it bad if I pipe and leave?
Her ex man fell off, she made man jollof
And said 'It's better than rice and peas" (No way)
Ciroc, no chase
Your bum can't fit in them jeans, there's no space
I tell her come climb on my wood and go ape
Dem girls say they're happy for you, they're so fake
Backshots, now I'm pulling on bundles (Backshots)
She don't take money from uncles (Never)
Sauvage on my neck, said she liking the smell
Can't do it like us man, a lie them ah tell (Behave)
Ciroc with the ice
Live life, never worry 'bout the price
Thick thighs, I can see it in your eyes, yeah
She just want that ghetto love
Yeah, gyal so hood, mi nuh lie
Never let another man try
Pull up on my gyal, it’s that time, yeah
She just want that ghetto love

She want love from the ghetto
And a pornstar with prosecco
Christian Louboutin, the stiletto
No fuckboys, but you didn't get the memo
Yeah, no stress (nah)
More life, more sex
We live a lot, uh
Like what's next?
And we don't ever run back to the ex, no
Buy a few drinks, then tell 'em it's on me
If they don't believe, then tell 'em they go and see
I sent your girlfriend aubergine emoji
She sent me back eyes, man she's so naughty
Fuckboys get the emoji knives
Buff gyal get the emoji eyes
Wanna put somethin' in your ovaries
My whole team winnin', man you know the vibes (Yeah, killa)

Glow in the Dark Lyrics
One time, one time

I knew what it was to be black way before I was on the GQ cover
How you gonna question me about colour?
What you know about Nelson Mandela?
Man, I get anti as ever
Yeah, I can do serious, I can do mean
Tell a supremacist that I'm supreme
Oh, everybody's woke now, guess I'm just lost in a dream
But still, I'm predicting the future, I said this is how shit would go
The streets at an all-time high, the government at an all-time low
Politicians tryna get tickets to come to the shows
I shake hands with a long arm, never get close
Can't see me, I stay ghost, man, I move like cigarette smoke
We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark
We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark
Oh yeah

They would love to see me on a pushbike pedalin' scores
18 pound 40, I was acceptin' shorts
Fast forward, see me on TV collectin' awards
One night with the gang
Now she can't understand why she used to hang around with them eediat man
I Nintendo Switch it, fam, I got the game in my hands
I'm a different species
Summertime, got a new swag for the beaches
Look in my wardrobe and it's all reference pieces
You should see how the price goes up as the money increases
I don't chill with them 'cause I can't deal with the disheartenin' speeches
When I say I'm out, then I mean it, hm

We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark
We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark
Oh yeah
You might also like
I can be my own worst enemy
But I gotta be my own best friend
I need to take the advice I been givin' to them
Man, are on a low frequency, I can't see them again
I'm on a high vibration, feeling blessed, grateful
Them man are thirsty, need hydration
Please don't compare me to them, that's a big violation
Manna got no direction and it's showin'
See how the game can trick you without you even knowin'
We're livin' in the dark, but I keep on glowin'
My mum gave me the seeds I'm sowin'
My dad gave me the tools and the water to keep them growin'
So when they tell us to go home, fam, I know where I'm goin'

We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark
We've be growin' apart
Been through the wars and I can show you the scars
Still on the road, I'm still on the boulevard
They should've told you that I glow in the dark

Green Light Lyrics
Girl you can pull up, It's a green light
I'll be mixin', I'll be sippin' in the meanwhile
Think you get me
That's why I let you meet the team now
Making movies, I think I might take up screenwritin' if you with me
Since I was knee high, they never wanted me to win and now I'm inside, getting litty
Everyday we live life
Pouring up and everyday we live life, we go litty

Now I got a green light
Started chasing dreams when I was knee high
Pouring up and sippin' now we live life
I will never stop before the red light
Riding a big Benz, rocking that big drip
Them so sea sick, them so big trip
Now we flossin', now we bossin'
Gucci bands, Gucci socks for this flossin'
Money ridin' in a Benz
Tuesday, make her bust it open in a Lamb
She in love and she a fan
Look in my eyes, say she love me 'til the end, yeah
Girl you can pull up, It's a green light
I'll be mixin', I'll be sippin' in the meanwhile
Think you get me
That's why I let you meet the team now
Making movies, I think I might take up screenwritin' if you with me
Since I was knee high, they never wanted me to win and now I'm inside, getting litty
Everyday we live life
Pouring up and everyday we live life, we go litty

Super star living in real life
I've been, fucking it up since I was still young
Still a kid and
Now, I'm chasing my dreams like
With the realest, chasing millions with the team
I'm, finna get it
I'm drippin, sauce I, feel like "Whoah!"
These women, on my, dick like "No!"
She think I'm inside
She saw me with Wizzy in the club in the VI, sitting with him
So now she tryna pull up and I
Can't let her do it 'less I'm tryna do some'n
So she gotta pull up with something for my niggas too huh
We keep it simple, never doin' too much
So I hit her back like...

Joy Lyrics
Oh nananana
Eh eh
In the early 90s
That was the beginning
Mama had me
She was definitely smiling
Finally a boy
She was very very happy
She prayed for those with the love of her life eh
She called me grace
She called me blessing
She looked into my eyes
Called me love of her life
I wish i could go back and feel what she felt
But she goes on her knees
And tell God what she felt eh
Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy
Showers of blessings
God blessed her plenty
Thank God for blessing
Love of my life eh
Joy nothing but joy
Every other day she feels nothing but joy
We didn't have much
She loved me still
When she thank God for blessing love of my life eh

When I was a little boy
Mama told me
My boy chase your dreams
And keep believing
And the sky will be your beginning
When I was a little boy
Mama told me
My boy chase your dreams
And keep believing
And your peak will be your beginning
When I was a little boy
Mama told me
Love will set you free
My boy please believe it
Cos this love is for real
When I was a little boy

Me I go chop till I belle full
Ok chop till I belle full
Chop till I belle full
Ok chop till I belle full
Put together the mix of an incredible bliss
Better than all of the rest
Putting aside all the risk
Opposition by the wrist
They talk shit they get ma fist
All I do is make these hits (All we do is these hits)
Am giving maximum satisfaction
The world is a stage and am thе main attraction
Out for that dough that bread mine
Listen to thе news and baby am the headline
See everything brand new
Brand new year brand new attitude
Am proving unbelievers wrong they misunderstood
Got u thinking am the shit you gon’ need a loo
Mi o le beru rara kema koshi lo
If u aint talkin money I can’t hear at all
If u really don’t like it fimile jor
Am headed not just for a grammy men I want it all

Kissing the good life under the mistletoe
The hustle is official without a whistle bro
I painted a perfect picture with ma story yo
Now get your cameras out and watch me strike a pose oh!
And you know how the story goes
What you wanna reap is what you must sow
Better than all higher than most
I can never get killed am already ghost
I exceeded all ma mortal limits
Am on a different planet feeling the spirit
Stunting in ma new outfit
The best team in the world is who am out with (E.M.Eazzzy)
Straight to the point cut to the chase
Had so much to drink can’t feel ma face
Y’all have time to hate I aint got time to waste

I swear say I do am for you
My love for you go beyond
Anything they want to show you
You give me the strength to carry on
That's why I go always love you
Girl I bad pass James Bond
And that's why I go fight for you
Girl I can't do without you, do without you
I gots to let you know
Girl e go break my heart
It will break my heart
If you ever leave me go
In the sunny and the rainy weather
I'll be there for you
So girl take my hand
And fly this flight
And let us fly away

Mamacita Lyrics
Oh, mamacita
Come, let's get more familiar
I like your style
I like your style
Hey, mamacita
Come, let's stay 'til mañana
I like your style
I like your style

Keep it hundred in the fast lane, so high
Like Amber Rose without the foreplay, four fives
We gettin' money, baby, no shame, hold tight
You take a selfie, girl, you're so vain, don't lie
You know I love it, baby, no way, oh my
You know I like the way you rotate, close thighs
Copacabana and your Dolce, all lies
It's not my lady, but it's okay, I know why
You're super wavy baby, oh
Baby, you're my cup o' tea
And I really wanna be in your company
Any good thing comin' is gon' come to me
When I pop, pop, pop in your dungarees
And again, 20 and 0, undefeated
The batty so big, my squad don't believe it
And haters gonna diss like, Drizzy like, Chris like
Trippin', this is it life, now I'm singin' this like

You only make it if you grow free, don't die
Remember startin' up my own wave, won't lie
I used to bus it, baby, no train, no sky
Now when you bust it baby throw shade on those guys
You know I liked you back in '08, '09
You used to call me on my house phone, late night
My mum complainin' but it's okay, it's your time
Protectfully, my baby, oh
Baby, you're my cup o' tea
And I really wanna be in your company
Cause the whole industry is tryna come for me
Dirty pictures on the 'Gram, save some for me
Hotter than 81 degrees
Yeah, none of them girls got nothin' on your steez
Yeah and haters gettin' dissed like, smiley with a kiss like

Hey, mamacita
Come, let's stay 'til mañana
I like your style
I like your style

L'obiettivo di stasera è andare via con lei
Ciao di dove sei? Di che segno sei?
Ti ho già vista su Insta, ne son sicuro
Baby giuro ti ho riconosciuta dal culo
Scommetto che in palestra ti spacchi di squat
Adesso che ti ho vista so che non è Photoshop
Le tue poppe sono super, come Mario
Se ti guardo di profilo sembri un dromedario
Il tuo corpo è un luna park, come a Gardaland
Del tipo, passi in strada e tutti fanno "guarda là"
Vorrei farmi un giro sul tuo girovita
Così stretto che da svestita sembri una clessidra
Mamacita sei l'unica tipa
Che presenterei a mia mamma per quanto sei figa
(Sei troppo figa)
Se ti vesti in rosso accetterò la sfida
Tu lei  io il toro nella corrida
Mamacita

Many Men Lyrics
They try to out the boy in a box
Am still HERE, bow tie with the tucks
Am still HERE Gucci down to my socks
Man stocks hundred mil in the walks
The other hundred mil, i put it down real estate
I swear my taxes i keep it fxxking up to date
I’ve been grinding from the bottom to the penthouse
Suite to be looking bches out of Florida
Fxxk the godfather, all i need is God the father
Everytime i talk, cats wanna stick the DOLLAR
Feminine boory shaking like my flow reggae
But its only why that, forgive them holy father
They pray for pot hole and mishaps
They pray wizzi fight eme and live on a sore milk
They pray for blood on YOUR white coat
So they can pose with Tv at YOUR moda moda fxxkin funeral

You too hot, you give me heat rash
There's nothing like you girl, you're like free cash
If i catch you, you no go escape
If we rode together, you'll be the riesler to my SK
Many girls promise love on the first date
But every man dey there, omo dat one na estate
You got your head straight but got a nice shape
Your body is smoking hot, you need a ashtray
I protect you till my last day
They got the boss mess with you, imma castrate
I know you think we moving at a fast pace
I don't really care, this is my last race
I know your ex left a bad taste
But i am toothpaste, this is a new face, how does that taste
Be mine, be mine

Wherever you go, i wanna be…oh Lord of mercy

I always change gear, but I ride automatically
They compare me with the greatest and willingly I agree
I'm a big ass problem, industry government
I flow with intellect got the hood like I'm Robin
I'm sitting on the hill top, a lot is being expected
Now I'm getting salutes from the rappers I respected
Hehe, now I'm smiling to the bank
Freestyling with the gang
Still flying with the bird
And if you listen close, the record is on demand
And I don't listen to this hater talking
I'm trying to build a brand like

Oh, they'd shitty rappers nobody can harm me

Mama told me, "Boy, don't stop, don't give up"
Mi no lie
Started from the streets, to my mandem, big up
Yeah, GoldLink is a good example for the assholes and the adolescents
Big dawg with a great smile, look like shark poker, yeah they get aggressive
Skin glossy than a mothafucka, teeth sharper than my lip
So my teeth cut my lip, I put a diamond on that bitch
Jewish star for the set, yeah this summer had us movin' different
Tat an eagle on my neck, 'cause this winter we was flyin' different
And my niggas show and prove, still be rappin' like I'm broke
How a youngin' this smooth? I'm really daddy with the stroke, yeah

Went from duckin' coppers, now we duckin' paparazzi now
Fine lil' tall black chick with an accent, she a model now
Drinkin' bubbly liquor while I'm starin' at her, lookin' nothin' like she talk
They remember when I was a youngin', had the .40 draggin' when they walk, huh
Blue flaggin' while I'm parasailin' with the boys and models out in Italy
Couple months ago, I was in the city on a date with a single ting
You'd prolly know her, and I never show, and she told me how she get security
But I always tell her I'm a hood nigga and this famous shit is new to me
Been down with the leg walk, old Versace for the jeans
I understand how my plug talk, I got Cuban in my genes
Never cubic on my neck, I got diamonds that'll bling
I got shooters that'll blitz, and all you'll hear is dirty screams
Give me neck, give me neck, uh, trade my girl for a jet, uh
Trade her soul for some pocket change
Want the world, nothin' less
Kill a rapper for respect, huh
Kill a rapper for respect, huh
Kill a nigga for a North Face
And some braggin' rights and a TEC

When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television

Every day say we dey hustle. We just tryna make a
Living, but bad man say dem don't likeee ohhhhI kept
On believing, what you see sometimes can be
Deceiving. Man crying, still see, and the death still
Talk and am still breathing. Suffer doesn't kill you

Hundred meters, dey say dey wan run hundred
Meters. Dey want to go my way, look distance
I say bad man, look distance. I love the life I'm living
I thank my God for giving, the glitters can be
Deceiving. Some people don't pray for your healing
My brother. Look sharp, stop sleeping. I swear I
Know that feeling, of everything breaking down
Things going around
I just bounce back and say say **Se b'Oluwa

One Dance Lyrics
Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'for I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
His taking a hold on me

Baby, baby, I like your style
Baby, baby, I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you get a text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Baby I like your style

Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe

Even when he's away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT

Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over

Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting

Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over, say

One Dance (Ivisson Legendas Edit) Lyrics
Baby, I like your style

Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don’t know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time ’fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh, girl

I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin’, put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time ’fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
Hold on me

Ten toes down 'til the grave
Now I'm seein' six figures everyday

Prices Lyrics(Uh huh)
Think you can handle
Think you can handle us
Think you
Think you
Think you can handle us
(Camp Mulla)

Riding in a ghost
Smoking ain’t no lie
I dont see nobody, I dont hear nobody
Listening to mulla
Thinking of my mulla
Weezy on my feet, Yeah I'm naughty naughty
Yea I pray for blessings young G making paper
Yeah my mama told me, never stop never delay
Steady on my grind I got this beat inside me
Music flowing, deep inside me
Shappa-Mehn
Okay I'm out hear
Tryna function cooler than I once was
Cop it like its nothing
Morning the side of the compass
Im passing it with honors
Now we're eat a lobster
Things done changed for me
Since I was younger
Riding round in nairobi
Real niggas only
I'm 19 and I’m touring
My couture is foreign
My sneakers say air Jordan
Snitches still reporting
I’m out here recording
I’m out here importing

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when I walk into the store, there’s no reason I should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more
(Cos ’ve been working no play, if I deserve it I’ll pay)

Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard

I consider these rhymes
As my reason to exist, Reason to be missed
Sold you but a season worth of hits
Speaking is a bitch, Have to reconfigure what I spit
Teachers if you sit down to preacher of the kids
You could learn, That music has turned into a medicine
Saving the youths and also many many many men
Plenty will spend on this record, Till we make our ends
So pardon the benzes, I’m rocking up with all her friends

Yeah
Because there’s something bout this life (this life)
Born for this we are
I can’t explain but its inevitable
Destined for greatness
Effortlessly making hits
Who knew it'd turn out like this

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when I walk into the store, there’s no reason I should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more
(Cos ’ve been working no play, if I deserve it I’ll pay)
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard

I got that Louis V. in my closet
Riding round and I’m getting it
Show money deposit
Touring out in all jets and shit
Betting it, all these fly kicks I be rocking
Nice whips I pull up in
Got your girl out here letting it (Boy)
Foreign brands on a nigga, watchu know about it
Fendi frames, while I’m switching lanes
And I’m smoking loud sh*t
So what they bothering for
I pull up in a ghost, with your hoe, cos nigga

We don’t even ask for prices no more
(when I walk into the store, there’s no reason I should know)
We don’t even ask for prices no more
(Cos ’ve been working no play, if I deserve it I’ll pay)

Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
Cos we ball, we top charts, we young cats, we work hard
We don't even ask for prices no more
We-we don't even ask for prices no more

Don't fuck around, I got my pistol on me
So much money, I got money on me
I let my mama hold a hundred thousand
I let my sister hold two hundred thou
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Private jets in my Jays
Nga-phone-a uber yam letha
Yabona manje siyabaleka
Rasta, roll up the weed one time
Give me that cheese one time
I wanna feel cool one time
Give me that tree one time
Fuck that bitch one time
Rasta, roll up the weed one time
Give me that cheese one time
I wanna feel cool one time
Give me that tree one time
Fuck that bitch one time
I pray, love come my way
She knows she loves my way
My love for money got me workin' on a Saturday
My love for money got me grindin' on a Sunday
I know, you love my way
I pray, love comes my way
My love for money got me workin' on a Saturday
My love for money got me grindin' on a Sunday
If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets

No matter what I know they see us
I see they hatin' that's 'cause we up
Stop talkin' light the tree up
This is no remix, this the re-up
Azishe one time, s'phile one time
Akufiwe one time, siz'wise one time
Sin'bise one time, nani n'fike one time
Roll up one time, then we smoke some one time
I'm on the scene clever ungazong' tshela
I got Wiz, I got Supa Mega
Do it if you think you better
Ngizokushaya nge s'cima if you think you clever

If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets

I'm catching flights while niggas catch emotions
These flashing lights will make you lose your focus
That's the reason I'm so antisocial
Season after season, cheese at my disposal
A week in Mozambique to catch my breath
Smoke a lot of dank, brush up on my Portuguese
Yeah the crown heavy on my head
It's a lot of pressure
Clouds of the Mary Jane help me get perspective
Higher grade, dumb it down
Blowing pounds, ganja clouds
Way way out in London town, nearly missed my baby ultrasound
We been through this shit before
Niggas talking greasy on the TV, that's that cooking oil
Trouble's what you looking for
When the fam' come through, all we ever do is flex
Tryna make handsome loot, shoutout my Sandton crew
Emtee we in this sitch'
Feel like it's time to roll another jet
Yeah, yeah watch me suffer from success

If she tripping leave that bitch alone
That's why you never catch a nigga sober
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets
There they go talkin' like they know
Me and you is not the same bro
I'm gettin' it cause I prayed yo
They dancing, but who is to blame though? (Me)
I be on the phone talking 'bout some deals phela
I'm working hard so don't you hate on me, I been fed up
Uthatha ma chance and you think you gonna win? Never!
Mawuphethe mali uyaphaula kanti yin' clever?
Woah, out here with them OG's baby
Your boyfriend actin' like he know me baby

If she tripping leave that bitch alone (It's the re-up)
That's why you never catch a nigga sober (It's the re-up)
Hotboxin' til the spliff is over (It's the re-up)
I'm never scared, got no pistol on me (It's the re-up)
Krapa, fasa, baba let's
Start rolling up the jets
Krapa, fasa, baba let's

But I dey pray make all of them rundown
Dem dey pray make we star no shine
But I pray make all of dem slow down

And my sexy girl she from China
But my Lagos girl she’s finer

While they were bumping & grinding, my mind was on grinding, bumping Rabadaba
We the realest out Rubaga, catch a bodybag, Abaga
With Frank White, in Black House, I been Barack'ing since Baraka
All my whoadies are with me, they keep it a hunnid & 50
Had accounts in the minus, but now my mind is on a victory
Though my target's up where Wiz be, you know my heart is where the kids be
When music makes me a milli I'll split it with 40/40 50-50
Swerve in a Benzo, we riding with Billy B
Friends turn to foes, when you're close, it's how it goes, yeah you know how it really be
Off that loud, girl quit yelling, it's driving me nuts & I'm Dizzy, G
She know I don't play with the mic like I'm Ziggy Dee
Kiro na misana, kiro na misana
Ask baby, for the cash baby, I go Kasbaby at Pana

Stay with me, that's what Sam sung when her iPhone ring..

I'm like, "Is that your new girl on your arm?" Yeeah, I'ma have to remove that
She's texting me, want my ding-a-ling, wanna do the ting-a-ling-a-ling
Til my bell a ring-ring, wanna sing-sing outchea for a real king like uh..
Yo, I'm about my biz kid
Pissing them off with my cleverness yo, I'm a wiz, kid

The girls, they be texting me clichés, it's been a while baby, how you been?
I know what they want, banoonya ba Don, to settle the bills they collected/
Nobody gat time for it/
On the budget that I'm balling/
Order rolex, akabulijjo for me and the fellas then I'm gone/
Like Kasangati's president, when he sneaking up out of his residence/
Hoodie on, something like Shabba, trying to be cool like doing the jabba/
Propa...something like Iguodala, when I ball, I shine at the right time/
The shooters that gat my back tho, they warriors ready to snipe/
But...we ain't here to fight, just some fellas looking for a goodnight/
So turn up that wiz kid, while I hit this and pass, cause the team is living a good life...

Keep on takin shots and you gon get the saba saba
Tuja babya, from Kampala to Lusaka, towakana
Had a girl from Hana, on her knees for no Hosanna
Said her hair was real, oh no it's from Copacabana
So I had to dump her, you know, playa boys will be Bafana
Found another kyana when I made it PULA in Botswana
I'm RAPPING WITH THE LADIES I like them XTRA NAKED
That girl you call your baby, is now your ex and taken
She had that tingaling, and she was makin noise
I'm Mr. LOVER-MAN, why you hatin-boy?
They say the crew has been quiet, but you know we be on that loud
We smokin the best, and we drinkin the hardest so you know that there is no vino allowed
The irony tho, is I'm tellin this shawty to wine like a pro
She drop on the floor and she says at the end of the night we can go find a couple of trees we can blow

Single For The Night Lyrics
Stay fresh in my Timber
(Got 2 piece ya Dickies, you with me)
Recognize when a bad man single
(Whenever I'm single for the night)
I like to party
(I got her feeling single for the night)
She likes it naughty
(See whenever I'm single for the night)
I like to party
(Got her, I got her feeling single for the night)
She likes it naughty
(Say abashwe, abashwe, abashwe, abashwe, abashwe)
Man everyday is a show though
They scream and I'm passing
The combo, low-key, high fashion
I don't say much, they mack with compassion
Rich bitch, we left in her Aston
Always got the baddest bitches and my miss
She ain't, a gold digger but she glad that I'm rich
Put a Rose Gold Datejust on my wrist
None of you skanks can fuck with my bitch
Go to London, quick stop in Qatar
As' lal, as' lal, as' khathal'
Askies love, ngicela uk' buza my love
How many of y'all can fit in my car? cause I...

Stay fresh in my Timber

Flew some girls down from Trinidad
I've never met a girl who told me that she had a man
My homie asked me how I do it, I say "Hey, sheba fela, sheba fela, sheba fela wena"

Baby I be on the go, can you love me now?

It takes some lovin' to get you
Love when I get you
I hope my lovin' affects you
Touch and caress you

Give me love don't stop
Coke on our stuff
Shut off the flame and cook up the top
Shoulda called me baby

Give me love don't stop
Coke on our stuff
Shut off the flame and cook up the top
Shoulda called me baby

Tic and toc don't have to find luck
Sniff and fuck, she pon' the counter
Slow for me baby, one more for me, baby

You ain't real if you ain't took nothin'
One time, my niggas off in Brooklyn
Shout my niggas in California
Where your enemies, they be on ya
One time for Atlanta
Nigga make million off his Country Grammar
In Detroit, they don't think twice
Thousand pounds, hundred bricks, yea that good life

Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah
Damn it's about to be a scene tonight
When we pull up in them things, tonight
Yellow golden diamond rings, tonight
We're livin that good life (Yea!)
Livin' that good life
Livin' that good life (ayyyy)
Livin' that good life (yeeeaaaa)
Introduce you to that good life
Spent a rack on the belt, sip by myself
Stay away from suckers 'cause they bad for my health
Blew a kilo in Cavalli, oh I think I need some help
These niggas screamin' rich, I'm just trying to chase some wealth
.40 cal Glock edition, I tote it myself
Niggas get to bangin', I will bang this bitch myself
What'chu know about them 2-door shifts wit no tops
Jordan sandals on, might drive it with no socks
What the fuck you expect? A nigga used to sell rocks
Hit the interstate in a rental wit them blocks
Talkin' push button start, no need for keys
We ain't like them other niggas, baby we's is G's
Yea that good life

Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah
Damn it's about to be a scene tonight
When we pull up in them things, tonight
Yellow golden diamond rings, tonight
We're livin that good life (Yea!)
Livin' that good life
Livin' that good life (ayyyy)

Introduce you to that good life

You know you livin' when you livin' bout 40 floors up
Valet get ya car, they gotta lift them doors up
Straight to the penthouse, tear them whores up
Next time them hoes with you, tell them bitches I say "What's up?"
Got me a taste of that success and I can't get enough
Mix the haters with the fakers, that shit could be rough
Real talk, fuck em, 'member mom couldn't pay her bills
No gas in the winter gave me the chills
Posted in the projects smokin' reefer (Now what we doin?)
Now a days niggas two tone Cohibas
Dom P for the pain
Po' up a shot of Avion for the game

Chillin' with G Armani, speakin' Italiani
Spend my 30 stacks in a weekend down in Milano, yeaah
Yea, we party with mamacitas
We don’t wear them Rollies
Lost em' rose gold, yellow, yeaaah

From Atlanta all the way to Milan
My bitches live a good life forever

Na turn by turn i don dey go
Na turn by turn do your own
Na turn by turn i don dey go
Na turn by turn do your own
I say na tinini tanana ooo
Na tinini tanana ooo
Am just a young girl at the age of 22
Done a lot of stuff that i didn't have to do
Been through lot of stuff that i didn't have to go through
Back when i didn't have a clue
Now a little older and much wiser
Been through the hustle and ive been through the fire
What didn't kill me only made me stronger
Now is the time to rise fro the ashes
Hold my hеad high as the camera flashes
Now is thе time to take whats mine
2000 and mine now shine
I rose from poverty
To properties defination of a hustler
And i get many many land
For VGC so am waiting for my customers
They go see us dey look like televison
We no get no time for competition
Kel ad YQ combination
E be like obama ****
Life na tinini tanana ooo, leave me alone
Them say i no go blow leave me alone
Na turn by turn i don dey go

Na turn by turn i don dey go
Na turn by turn do your own
I say na tinini tanana ooo

YQ mehn shey you gree
You know ive been cooked to the right degree
No matter what they say i'd still be on top
Looking down on noone stay looking up
To me to show em the way forward
Still tryna catch up press fastfoward
Two steps ahead while they fall behind
Thats why they always tryna pause and rewind
I dont want always talking about what am gonna do
Its time to show these fools that am very capable
Taking they smack and throw it in they faces
Show them that am ready to more than just take this
To the next level cause am done playing games
Roll with your week issues so lame
Haven't you heard i run this game
Common now mehn say my name
I say na tinini tanana ooo
Na tinini tanana eeee
Kel and YQ in a place to be
Common now just follow me
And its so plain to see
That we run this shit in this industry
We gon take you higher
Do this and make you say the devil is a liar
Cause we got God on our side
Everything will ve alright
Life na tinini tanana ooo, leave me alone
Them say i no go blow leave me alone
Na turn by turn i don dey go
Na turn by turn do your own
Na turn by turn i don dey go

U Don’t Know Lyrics
Boo, what you tryna prove? Can we just talk about it?
Got nothin' left to lose but you still walk around it
And I'm the one who chooses to still wonder 'bout you
I think I know the truth, but sometimes I doubt it

And I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down
'Cause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now

But you don't know it
You don't know it
You don't know it
You don't even know it
I try to keep my cool, but it's too hard to tell if
You played me for a fool or your heart finally felt it
And you're the one who's losin', you're too fuckin' selfish
I didn't wanna do this, but I just can't help it

And I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down
'Cause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now

But you don't know it
You don't know it, you don't know it
You don't know it
You don't even know it

If you wanna leave, my girl, you better leave
I really got a lot to offer, please
She said she stay, abeg don't bother, please
I got your message, baby, don't repeat
I know your body murder but baby chill
You ain't that special, baby, don't believe
'Cause what we have is never meant to be
No disrespect, but you set the tone

Voodoo Lyrics
Am I sick in my mind?
I think about you all of the time
All day you're inside
Oh oh oh, it kind of blows my mind
It blurs, it blinds
'Cause deep down desire
Oh, don't you know I walk through fire
With which dark disease
Don't let me go
To share it
'Cause you set me free
When you work your magic on me
Oh it's so surreal
Voo- voodoo
To share it
Put a spell on me
'Cause when you work your magic, I'm free
Oh yeah, I know you do
Voo- voodoo

Get on the bounce (Uh huh) all night long (Uh huh)
Work your magic (Uh huh) all on me (On me)
Get on the bounce (Work it out) all night long (Work it out)
Work your magic (Work it out) all on me

Ella es viento y fuego
Mi corazón hechizó
Ella me hizo un voodoocito
Así dentro de mí, ay
Su magia puro amor
Sin truquitos o no
No, ay baby qué divino

Wizkid Interlude Lyrics

Say I wanna leave you in the mornin'
But I need you now, yeah, yeah
I find you, I give you all you needin'
I know you what you like
I feel it comin'
Time is of the essence
I tried to teach you
But I'm gon' need some lessons
I need to give it all
I tried to leave but I can't

Turn me out of my mind
You don't need no other body
You don't need no other body
Only you fi hold my body
